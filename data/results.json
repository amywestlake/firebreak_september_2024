Director Alexander Dovzhenko could not have foreseen this, however, and his priorities were poetic rather than political. After Earth was denounced as Ukrainian nationalist propaganda, Dovzhenko lost his job at the Kiev Film Institute.

These companion pieces, shot two years apart on tight budgets with BFI support, evoke his upbringing in Liverpool after the war in a working-class home dominated by the violence of his father, fearsomely played by then newcomer Pete Postlethwaite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davies achieves the rare feat of nostalgia without sentimentality, using dynamic lighting, a superb soundtrack and a fragmented structure to construct a distinctive drama suffused with both beauty and horror. From the home to the pub, the cinema to the beach, each locale suggests both charm and stifling limitation in a film that’s as concerned with the operation of memory as with its material setting.</p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>David Cronenberg’s mind-bending mixture of Marshall McLuhan-inspired media theory and grotesque bodily transformation remains one of the 1980s’ ultimate outré extremes. When TV producer Max Renn (James Woods) discovers the pirate broadcast of a seemingly real torture show, he becomes drawn into a dangerous and increasingly hallucinatory conspiracy to indoctrinate the North American viewing public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renn’s sense of reality becomes further fractured once two rival, shadowy organisations begin reprogramming him by inserting organic ‘videotapes’ into the gaping orifice he’s developed in his abdomen. With its images of sadomasochism and graphic fusion of man and machine, Videodrome may be one of David Cronenberg’s most visually extreme experiences, but it’s also his most influential and intelligent. And while the videotape-based technology featured in the film may have dated, its ideas around media proliferation and viral dissemination remain as relevant as ever.</p>\r\n",

It’s also dense with political and literary allusions – a tale of Dostoevskyian doppelgangers set in the divided city of Berlin. The relentless energy of Andrzej Zulawski’s prowling camerawork is matched in kineticism by Adjani’s thoroughly demented performance, which earned her a best actress award at Cannes. Completing the film’s bizarre backstory, Possession also found itself ill-fittingly included on the infamous ‘video nasty’ list of outlawed cassettes in the early 1980s. With creature effects by the Oscar-winning creator of E.T, Carlos Rambaldi, Possession is filmmaking at its most frenzied, fraught and furious.</p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>After a decade of directing and/or writing overtly comedic films, Woody Allen’s fortieth birthday heralded a dramatic gear-change. While Annie Hall offers at least as many laughs as its predecessors, they’re now drawn from the autobiographical roots of Allen’s own anxieties about life and relationships: Diane Keaton, who plays the title character, was once his real-life girlfriend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film was originally called Anhedonia – a condition that inhibits the inability to experience pleasure – and that’s Allen’s alter ego Alvy Singer’s problem. Brought up beneath the Coney Island rollercoaster (allegedly, but it’s an eye-catching image), he treats life as though it was a similarly perilous brake-free journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Casual asides are deconstructed for latent anti-Semitism, strangers are asked for relationship advice (“We use a large vibrating egg”, recommends an elderly passer-by), lovers are reconciled over a spider in the bathtub panic, and the theorist Marshall McLuhan is spontaneously produced to settle an argument with an annoying pedant.</p>\r\n",

A Clockwork Orange stars Malcolm McDowell as Alex, an adolescent whose principal interests include rape, assault and Beethoven, and who is eventually subjected to extreme aversion therapy by the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film’s bravura style, comprising modish interiors, Wendy Carlos’s electronic score and Burgess’s invented ‘Nadsat’ dialect, was overshadowed by its exuberantly realised sexual violence. Controversy led to the film’s withdrawal from British exhibition for over two decades. It remains a powerful essay on the pleasures and consequences of physical and psychological violence.</p>\r\n",

You don’t want to know too much about Petite Maman in advance to fully appreciate its quiet yet powerful magic.

Griffith’s 1915 The Birth of a Nation was a milestone in narrative filmmaking and a popular sensation, but a film condemned for its sympathetic depiction of the Ku Klux Klan. In answer, Griffith conceived this study of intolerance throughout human history, interspersing a Babylonian story, the Christ story, the events of the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre in 16th-century France, and a modern American story in which moral puritanism leads to a disenfranchised man being mistakenly condemned to death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film cuts between these stories with increasing rapidity as it builds to its exciting quadruple climax, though the complexity of this structure proved too enervating for contemporary audiences and the film was a commercial disaster. The Babylon set was at the time the most extravagant produced in Hollywood.</p>\r\n",

Here, in the fifth of his Comedies and Proverbs series of films, Eric Rohmer explores the frustration of a woman, Delphine (Marie Rivière), whose faith in such serendipity is being tested. Weaving a quietly riveting account of Delphine’s aborted attempts at leaving Paris for a summer holiday, the film addresses her romantic idealism with both wry amusement and deep&nbsp;sympathy.</p>\r\n",

The film’s blend of the middle-class everyday, Robert Krasker’s atmospheric black and white cinematography and Rachmaninoff’s swooning 2nd Piano Concerto remains powerfully affecting. The film quivers with pent-up emotion in a way that must have been even more potent on its release in 1945 – just months after the end of World War II – than it is today.</p>\r\n",

This shady cycle often featured treacherous women (femmes fatales) duping guileless men. Few of these were more alluring than Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), who ensnares policy salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) in her scheme to do away with her husband and claim the insurance payout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adapted from a James M. Cain story by émigré Billy Wilder and novelist Raymond Chandler, and told within a clever flashback structure as Neff leaves a taped confession for his wily colleague Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), the film is a wellspring of the noir style, with John F. Seitz’s cinematography a textbook in angles and shadow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cain’s work was the basis for two subsequent classics of 1940s noir: Mildred Pierce (1945) and The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946).</p>\r\n",

Unlike the suave, moustachioed count of Stoker’s novel, Murnau’s Count Orlok is immortally embodied by actor Max Shreck as a bald and bulbous ghoul whose emaciated fingers cast fearful, flickering shadows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forsaking the highly stylised sets typical of German expressionist films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), Murnau imparted a sense of dread to a real world of forests, mountains and open sea. Stoker’s widow sued the production company for its unauthorised adaptation, but the damage was done: the vampire had entered the jugular of popular cinema and the contagion is still with us a century later.</p>\r\n",

Greed is the most infamously broken-backed of his films, originally screened in a version close to ten hours long but nervously hacked down by the newly formed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio to conventional length.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adapting the 1899 novel McTeague by Frank Norris about the downfall of a lottery-winning woman and the two best friends who love her, Von Stroheim aimed to render the book in complete detail, allowing screen time to develop characters of startling psychological intensity. Expensively, he also insisted on shooting on location, including in the debilitating heat of Death Valley for the film’s tragic climax. Though the bulk of Greed is lost, what remains is considered a milestone for its powerful fusion of naturalism and melodrama.</p>\r\n",

For the remarkable central sequence, when Hidetora’s Third Castle is ambushed by the forces of his elder sons, Kurosawa omits sound, relying on Toru Takemitsu’s score to help impart the dreadful force of the battle.</p>\r\n",

Despite its lush location, Black Narcissus was filmed in Pinewood, with exterior scenes shot in a garden in Horsham.

Her wealthy husband Bhupati (Sailen Mukherjee), the high-minded editor of a political journal, is too preoccupied with the latest tax legislation and the forthcoming English election (Disraeli v Gladstone) to pay much attention to his wife. Somewhat unwisely, he invites his charming younger cousin Amal (Soumitra Chatterjee, who previously starred in Ray’s The World of Apu) to come and keep her company. An aspiring writer who shares Charulata’s passion for poetry, Amal is keen to encourage her literary&nbsp;talent...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a household of seething, suppressed emotions, subtly revealed by Subrata Mitra’s eloquent camera. A richly atmospheric soundtrack – bird song, horses’ hooves, the cry of the kulfi vendor – evokes the wider world, while Ray’s wistful score and the romantic songs beloved of Charulata and Amal heighten the sense of&nbsp;longing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adapted from a 1901 novella, Nastanirh (The Broken Nest) by the great Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore, Charulata was described by its director as “the one film I would make the same way if I had to do it&nbsp;again”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enthusiastically received at home and abroad, Charulata was awarded the Silver Bear for Best Direction at the Berlin Film Festival of 1965.</p>\r\n",

Vitti – Antonioni's lover and muse, and the star of his earlier films L'avventura, L'eclisse and La notte – gives a magnificent, startling performance. She is ably accompanied by Carlo Chionetti as her unemotional husband Ugo, and Richard Harris as Corrado, Ugo's restless associate who finds himself drawn to her.</p>\r\n",

With its monochrome photography by the great Gabriel Figueroa now restored to its luminous glory, Buñuel’s ‘social-surrealist’ landmark is a primal howl of a film – once seen, never forgotten.</p>\r\n",

Even Christ’s miraculous healing of the sick is conveyed using nothing more complicated than editing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film was photographed in stark black and white by his frequent collaborator Tonino Delli Colli, and performed by a cast of non-professional actors including the director’s own mother as Mary, and Spanish economics student Enrique Irazoqui as Christ.

That’s a major injustice in the case of this deeply compassionate modern-dress character study, which is reportedly director Steven Spielberg’s favourite film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Takashi Shimura is utterly convincing as the reserved local government functionary who’s stayed in the same job for decades by keeping his head down, yet when stomach cancer strikes he resolves to bring some meaning to an otherwise fruitless life. Scrupulously avoiding slushy sentiment, the film’s narrative structure then cleverly moves the focus to the old man’s perplexed colleagues, pertinently prompting every viewer to ponder their own contribution to the common good.</p>\r\n",

The Terror from Beyond Space (1958): both films are about a spaceship crew being terrorised by a murderous and largely unseen alien presence. But Alien’s genius lies in its visual and conceptual design, which impressed its backers enough to double the production budget, a decision that paid off in spades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film brought an unprecedented level of realism to the science fiction genre, while its graphically sexual imagery (much of it originating from the mind of Swiss artist H.R. Giger) fuelled PhD theses galore: the notorious ‘chest-burster’ set-piece as a bizarre allegory of childbirth for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, none of the impressive cast could fairly be described as a star (the two Britons, John Hurt and Ian Holm, were closest, but Sigourney Weaver was then totally unknown), and this added to the suspense: anyone could be picked off at any time.</p>\r\n",

For his richly intricate screenplay, Robert Towne researched historic power struggles over the water supply to Los Angeles, creating in tycoon Noah Cross – played by old-guard film director John Huston – one of cinema’s most disturbing villains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mystery plot has a classical simplicity, as Nicholson’s private eye Jake Gittes is drawn by his own curiosity into a situation in which he’s dangerously out of his depth, and where he endangers the very thing he sought to protect. The Los Angeles of the 1930s is immaculately recreated, with production design by Richard Sylbert.</p>\r\n",

A once famous singer now in her early 40s and retired in Stockholm, Gertrud makes the decision to leave Gustav, her lawyer husband for her lover, Erland, a young composer. Discovering the next day that Erland has betrayed her, and that he cannot make a total commitment to her, Gertrud rejects both husband and lover, choosing a life of solitude and study over the compromise of love that is merely half-measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Gertrud is a film I made with my heart’, said&nbsp;Carl Theodor Dreyer and its rigorously pared-down structure and stylised slowness, intricate camera movements and lighting effects show superbly how the art of his films were his truly great passion.</p>\r\n",

True, the story involves a certain angelic intervention to show him that his travails have all been worthwhile, yet it’s only because this modern parable plumbs the depths so vividly that its vision of redemption proves so persuasive. Its enduring popularity may indeed derive from Capra’s insistence that friendship matters more than material gain, a telling message of solace in a secular capitalist society.</p>\r\n",

Its unprecedented success changed the face of ‘independent’ cinema in America, helping establish distributor Miramax as a major player and ushering in a wave of exciting filmmakers, many of whom still hold sway in Hollywood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presented as three interconnected stories which unfold in a nonlinear melange, Tarantino’s sophisticatedly structured saga prefigured the rise of multi-stranded ‘hyperlink’ cinema in the 2000s. And its smorgasbord of pop culture references also introduced a new generation of fans to the likes of Dick Dale, MacGuffins and Ezekiel 25:17. Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1994, Pulp Fiction holds up as one of the most riotously entertaining nineties pictures, strewn with endlessly quotable dialogue and an array of career-defining performances from its ensemble cast, with Samuel L Jackson stealing the show as Biblical badass Jules Winnfield.</p>\r\n",

Through flashbacks we witness the dramas of his time in the ring, his abusive marriages, and his turbulent relationship with his brother and manager Joey (Joe Pesci).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sequences between the ropes are extraordinarily immediate, with Michael Chapman’s mobile black and white cinematography closely attending every blow, and Thelma Schoonmaker’s editing brutally precise and dynamic. Robert De Niro famously gained weight to play the out of shape La Motta of later years.</p>\r\n",

Deemed inaccessible by Soviet authorities, it was re-cut and given a nominal release under the title The Colour of Pomegranates.

Most extreme in this madness is Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski), whose megalomaniac scheming proceeds from the mutinous to the murderous. At once a stirring but avowedly unsentimental tale of overweening ambition and a remarkably rich and original variation on the adventure film, Herzog’s masterpiece combines a flair for the epic with moments of incisive miniaturist observation. The images are breathtaking in their beauty, mystery and sense of scale; Kinski’s performance was arguably his best ever; and the sharp insights into human folly – sometimes sorrowful, sometimes darkly witty – typify Herzog at his most caustically effective.</p>\r\n",

Fittingly so, as this late work is a sombre reflection on what was lost when education and morality – incarnated by Stewart as East Coast lawyer Ransom Stoddard – crept westward as civilising influences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Told within a flashback framework, as Stoddard comes clean to the press about who really shot outlaw Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), Ford’s classic waves a bittersweet adieu to the bygone values of the Old West, typified by the rough justice of rancher Tom Doniphon (Wayne). The paper-men ultimately opt to “print the legend” – famous words that have been taken as a maxim for Ford’s own myth making.</p>\r\n",

Welles’ vivid turn as corpulent bent cop Quinlan provided one of the genre’s most memorable villains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iniquity south of the border also colours Welles’ prior film noir, The Lady from Shanghai (1947), starring his then-wife Rita Hayworth.</p>\r\n",

Opening with a starkly symbolic dream sequence, the film follows Professor Isak Borg as he journeys by car in the company of his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin) to collect an award from his former university. The trip occasions a series of reminiscences and reveries, as the ageing Borg revisits the scenes of his youth and reflects on an unhappy marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bergman pays tribute to his forebears by casting great silent filmmaker Victor Sjöstrom as Borg, but strikes out for a new form of intellectual cinema characterised by probing into the nature of existence. Wild Strawberries also became a model for the road movie.</p>\r\n",

The train driver who goes in dogged pursuit of his beloved engine is a classic Keaton character: stoical, determined and preternaturally straight-faced as chaos reigns around him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film is a seamless blend of action and comedy, involving a great number of stunts – including the famous sequence in which a bridge bearing a railroad train collapses into a gorge. The great expense that such moments incurred was remembered when the film was a commercial disaster, to the cost of Keaton’s future creative freedoms. Only decades later was The General recognised as one of silent cinema’s greatest comedies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It has the best script of any Keaton film. Each visual concept is unique and ingenious. Artistry of the highest level, and it’s hilarious!” <strong>Robert Mitchell</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The high-water mark for action movies for close to a hundred years. Keaton’s innovation and fearlessness were second to none and his screen persona still electrifies today.” <strong>Andrei Liimets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Breathtaking comic episodes elegantly composed and edited by an auteur with the mind of a civil engineer.” <strong>Noël Carroll</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Laughter is universal, and no one was funnier than Keaton in his prime.” <strong>Robert Cashill</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Tropical Malady was the title under which the artist and filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s 2004 feature was distributed in the UK and elsewhere. Its original Thai title, Sud Pralad, in fact means something like ‘strange beast’. This is perhaps a more apt characterisation of a film that compels through fierce natural strangeness rather than intimations of illness per se. More is going on here in terms of story, sense perception, sexuality, identity and spirituality than is easily accessible to mainstream sensibilities. But if that speaks to malady, it seems less a matter of infection or disease than the disordered expectation that the world will constrain itself to conventionally limited and contingent ways of thinking, feeling and understanding. Strange beasts are best met on their own ground, on their own terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film is a diptych of sorts. The first part introduces us to soldier Keng (Banlop Lomnoi), part of a group assigned to a rural area where unsettling killings of animals have been noted, perhaps the work of an unquiet spirit – the strange beast. There, Keng meets Tong (Sakda Kaewbuadee), a placid-seeming young man with whom he strikes up a flirtatious rapport. They spend time together in town and country, at the movies, taking a dog to the vet, exploring nearby shrines. In the second part, Keng is in the forest, alone, tracking and being tracked by the strange spirit, who seems to be at once Tong and a tiger. There are stalkings, struggles and submissions, encounters with ghost cows and clever monkeys. In both parts, transportive sound design and locked-off compositions frame interpersonal dynamics&nbsp;that tilt in unexpected ways. Queerness here is not only a matter of same-sex desire but of radical uncertainty, shifts between persons and worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a work that defies straightforward understanding and suggests that understandability may be overrated. (Benedict Anderson has argued that aspects of narrative, setting and character unfamiliar to the film’s cosmopolitan audiences are quite accessible to viewers from the region where the film was shot – yet even they were perplexed by other elements.) Apichatpong’s earlier features had won festival recognition but this was a breakthrough. In the years since, its calm indifference to staid forms of logic, hierarchy and desire have helped affirm it as a marvel of imaginative engagement with posthuman possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ben Walters</strong></p>\r\n",

It is like Mozart: light and tragic.” <strong>Christian Viviani</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Cinema’s most dazzling flow of imagery, with the chill of death in every transition.” <strong>Michael Phillips</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ophuls’ sublime testament to romantic yearnings.” <strong>Tom Ryan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The glove is velvet; the punch, hard.” <strong>Robert Cashill</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>With a title sometimes flowerily translated as ‘Tales of the Pale and Silvery Moon after the Rain’, Kenji Mizoguchi’s 1953 film Ugetsu Monogatari is a lyrical blend of period drama and ghostly fable. Uprooted by civil war, two peasant couples are split apart when the men – against the counsel of their wives – leave their families in search of greater fortune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ugetsu Monogatari is filmed in Mizoguchi’s distanced but all-encompassing camera style, full of flowing movement and respect for the action’s context, as the story of the men’s striving assumes the quality of an allegory. The film is especially celebrated for its subtly achieved supernatural elements: the spectral appearance of a boat through the mist, and the scenes in which the potter (Masayuki Mori) is lured to the castle of the mysterious Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyo).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Taking a journey through a watery, misty netherworld, the film is comfortable with the uncanny, but there are real-world lessons here about the toxicity of the male ego.” <strong>Donald Clarke</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In Mizoguchi’s use of the moving camera – detached yet empathetic – to express the conflict between male and female drives, his ineffably beautiful anti-war ghost fable is unparalleled.” <strong>Graham Fuller</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Mizoguchi’s contemplative style at its most expressively Bruegelesque.” <strong>Ramsey Campbell</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Mizoguchi’s greatest film bridges the realms of reality and fantasy so effortlessly, as if both realms exist in a single construct.” <strong>Tom Gunning</strong></p>\r\n",

Continuing his headlong reinvention of cinema (this was his tenth film in six years), Jean-Luc Godard used the model to tell the story of what he called the “last romantic couple”: a Parisian (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his babysitter (Godard’s then-wife Anna Karina) who take off for the south of France with a cache of gunrunning money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In true Godardian style, the flimsy plot played coathanger for satirical digressions (on commercialism and the Vietnam war), kaleidoscopic stylistic devices, sunny musical numbers and a merciless examination of male-female incompatibility, shot in intoxicating primary colours by Raoul Coutard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Possibly an end and a beginning for Godard. A frolicking escapist romantic road-trip adventure, but also a blistering critique of bourgeois culture, a political satire and a collage of anti-consumerist capitalism. Anna Karina’s star shines for herself.” <strong>Helen DeWitt</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The gangster noir template is chopped and broken, then reassembled as a bricolage of signifiers, to forge a mesmerising generic satire that also seems to reinvent colour.” <strong>Dario Llinares</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Following the big-budget failure of Dune, David Lynch’s dazzling return to more personal filmmaking earned him a second Oscar nomination. The discovery of a severed ear leads clean-cut Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle Maclachlan) to uncover a nightmarish flipside to sleepy small town Lumberton, as he becomes dangerously complicit in the perverse relationship between tormented chanteuse Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) and deranged gangster Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Informed both by the underground experiments of Kenneth Anger and the 1950s melodramas of Douglas Sirk, Lynch’s visually arresting film has a singularly skewed power. Alan Splet’s dense sound design and the first of the director’s many collaborations with composer Angelo Badalamenti contribute to the film’s immersive texture, while Hopper is unforgettable as one of cinema’s most unsettling grotesques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The perfect shaken-not-stirred Lynchtini. Simultaneously a Freudian Mother of All Bombs, a satire on the Hardy Boys, a psychosexual audience crucifixion, an elegy for lost innocence and a genuine mystery.” <strong>Michael Atkinson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Suburban America, freshly mown lawns and the tweeting of an artificial robin sitting alongside a dark underbelly represented by a severed human ear and a run-in with a psychopath... Taking the form of a surreal noir and as entertaining as it is horrifying, this is a film that is impossible to forget.” <strong>Justin Johnson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Blue Velvet is the logic of dreams and nightmares translated into film language.” <strong>Nemanja becanovic</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Lynch was leftfield even in the 80s, but the mainstream has caught up to his ordinary-uncanny sensibility.” <strong>Phil Hoad</strong></p>\r\n",

While City Lights (1931) was almost wholly silent however, Charlie Chaplin’s new film incorporated some sound effects and voices, alongside the by then archaic use of intertitles in place of dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chaplin admitted he didn’t know how to make the Tramp work in sound, but his ambivalence about the new technology was appropriate to the theme of Modern Times, which distils anxiety about the dehumanising effects of mechanised labour into inspired comedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sequences including the Tramp unable to stop his assembly-line bolt-tightening (to the alarm of passing women with temptingly placed buttons), or being conveyed helplessly through the cogs of a giant machine, found the director’s comic genius undimmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Chaplin’s final screen outing in the Little Tramp persona sees him taking on the impact of industrialisation on the working class. Modern Times marked Chaplin’s first use of dialogue on screen, albeit in Chaplin’s typically adventurous, unconventional way: when the audience finally hears the Tramp’s voice, he’s singing gibberish as the character improvises the lyrics to a song. While the Tramp rotates between prison and employment and life seems a constant struggle, Modern Times remains stubbornly hopeful and hilarious.“ <strong>David West</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“For releasing the human body into such kinetic chaos and comic élan, defying so many forces that would browbeat our bodies, our dreams, our movies into conformity.“ <strong>Nick Davis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The 20th century in 87 minutes.“ <strong>Paolo Mereghetti</strong></p>\r\n",

So I sat for four hours, watching a heavily compressed stream of an already low-resolution LaserDisc rip, and was totally mesmerised. The characters were Taiwanese yet I related so heavily to that search for identity and sense of alienation. In the years since, it’s only become more meaningful for me – it’s a profound study of a social ecosystem, our daily lives and its relation to a political situation, the hopes and dreams of youth we have despite it, and the mistakes we make when we believe the world is incomprehensible.” <strong>Neil Bahadur</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A film born out of both love for cinema and a deep desire to fully reform it. Yang understood mediality like few others; understood the underlying reasons for social violence and the aimlessness of youth like even fewer. His masterpiece traces a line from cinema past (Ozu Yasujirō) to cinema future (Tsai Mingliang, Lav Diaz).” <strong>Flavia Dima</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Narrated in flashback by the corpse of luckless screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) floating facedown in a Los Angeles swimming pool, Wilder’s audaciously dark examination of the Hollywood dream factory cruelly casts faded silent-movie star Gloria Swanson as has-been silent star Norma Desmond. Festering in the grandeur of her old dark mansion and daydreaming of comeback, the character is a brutal warning about the unchecked egotism of superstardom. “I’m still big!” she insists, “it’s the pictures that got small.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other real-life giants of the silent cinema – Erich von Stroheim, Cecil B. DeMille and Buster Keaton – fill out the murky corners of Wilder’s vision, which would later inspire a stage musical of the same name by Andrew Lloyd Webber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Lists, which can be strangely merciful, have taken pity on Norma Desmond.” <strong>Odie Henderson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A perfect marriage of film noir, metafiction, and the darkly comedic genius of Billy Wilder, Sunset Blvd. is both the most loving and the most scathing look Hollywood ever took at itself. To die is a terrible thing – but to be forgotten, that is the true tragedy.” <strong>Alan Mattli</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Noir, horror, melodrama. Homage to cinema and reflection on the decadence of the body and the image. The ghosts of silent cinema meet a dead body that tells its own story: a dance of celluloid spectres officiated by the great Erich von Stroheim and Gloria Swanson. “I am big.

Riding a crest of international recognition for Japanese cinema, initiated by Akira Kurosawa’s Rashomon (1950), Mizoguchi’s late period of creativity for the Daiei studio interspersed modern-day dramas with several widely acclaimed period dramas (jidai-geki).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sansho Dayu is set in Japan’s distant past and is the heartbreaking story of a brother and sister, the children of a noble governor, who are kidnapped and sold as slaves to the cruel bailiff Sansho (Eitaro Shindo). Years pass, and the divided mother and children grow desperate, then resigned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mizoguchi relays this tragedy – based on a novel by Ogai Mori with its basis in myth – with classical force. Filming in his signature long, flowing takes, the director builds inexorably to an emotionally devastatingly climax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I vote in awe of one of the greatest filmmakers our world has known. Blending the exquisite precision of his indigenous culture with a universal Weltanschauung, this is one of Mizoguchi’s masterpieces; poetry and melancholy are one with him. The viewer who is not deeply moved by the final scene, the rigorous outcome of the preceding political and personal events, has a heart of stone.” <strong>Eithne O’Neill</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The most beautiful and devastating of all Mizoguchi’s films.” <strong>Steven Shaviro</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Miyazaki Hayao, the co-founder and driving visionary behind Japan’s Studio Ghibli, is renowned for his world-spinning, fecund and furious animated fantasies: across his 11 features he has conjured pre-modern and post-apocalyptic, undersea and above-theclouds milieux teeming with angry earth gods and lost robots, apprentice witches and wracked wizards, flying pigs, runaway fish-girls and endless vivid bit-creations besides. (His Oscar-winner Spirited Away, nearby in this poll, spills forth a phantasmic bathhouse of troubled ghouls.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Neighbour Totoro is his less-is-more work: a pastoral, pantheist chamber drama, where the ‘chamber’ lies under the canopy of a great camphor tree that lords over the woods behind a tumbledown farmhouse. Into this adventure realm move two sisters, pre-school Mei and preteen Satsuke, with their inattentive dad, to be nearer their hospitalised mum. Each in&nbsp;turn encounters the spirit of the woods: a giant, furry, ovoid mammal with mighty powers of flying, horticulture and slumber. (He comes with two smaller surrogates, who may or may not indicate a further world of totori.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The storytelling is as simple as Totoro is inscrutable, unfolding in a series of delightful, exquisitely constructed sequences: Satsuke and Mei discovering the farmhouse and its soot-sprite occupants; Mei tracking Totoro’s minions to his lair; the tired children, waiting in the rain for their dad at a bus stop, finding Totoro waiting too – for a twinkle-eyed cat bus; a village-wide hunt for Mei after a misunderstood message from hospital leads her to run away. My favourite is the nocturne in which the girls and Totoros conjure shoots from acorns with an incantatory dance, then soar triumphant through the trees on a spinning top.&nbsp;There’s no plot, just rousing impressions of innocence and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So many films ask us to see the adult world through children’s eyes; My Neighbour Totoro summons wilder, wide-eyed wonder at the forces that inform us: life, nature, connection, change. And, of course, it hymns the uplift of imagination, with Joe Hisaishi’s entrancing synth tunes essential to the magic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film got two votes in Sight and Sound’s 2002 poll, 11 in 2012. A swift hit in Japan, it has spread its spell steadily across the world ever since; a third of a century after its release, many younger critics have grown up with it. It’s clearly an antidote to urbanisation and technology, and a rebuke to a world of environmental breakdown. It’s also a comfort and a reassurance that shows we still have artists who can create something timeless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nick Bradshaw</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>With a cycle of projects starring his wife Ingrid Bergman, Roberto Rossellini began to lose some of the critics whose attention he had grabbed with Rome: Open City (1945). Moving away from the neo-realist movement’s unflinching depiction of post-war social realities, he was beginning to chart the emotional relationships between his characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Katherine and Alexander Joyce (Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders) are an English couple holidaying in Naples whose marriage starts to fracture under the strains of mutual boredom and resentment. The striking looseness of Rossellini’s storytelling suggests the subjective textures of life, encompassing periods of dead time that anticipate the modernist art films of Michelangelo Antonioni.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“‘With the appearance of Journey to Italy, all films have suddenly aged ten years,’ Jacques Rivette wrote. Narratively open and fragmented, driven by melancholy, astonishment and the disruptive force of reality, it is the ideal junction in Rossellini’s filmography between the neorealist experience, his artistic collaboration with Ingrid Bergman, and the adventurous, avant-garde nature that would guide the great Roman director throughout his career.” <strong>Giulio Casadei</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>The Cannes Film Festival premiere of L’avventura in 1960 met with catcalls from audiences frustrated with the film’s inconclusiveness and the slowness of its pacing. Like Alfred Hitchcock in the same year’s Psycho, Michelangelo Antonioni upturned expectation by getting rid of his film’s ostensible protagonist early on. Unlike Hitchcock, however, Antonioni provided no explanation for this sudden disappearance of his female star, hinting only at the alienation and ennui that the film depicts as a characteristic of contemporary bourgeois society as a potential cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No less radical than this modernistic ambiguity was the Italian master’s controlled use of camera movement and visual composition to dramatise the emotional space between people. The film made a star of Monica Vitti, who plays Claudia, the missing woman’s friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Michelangelo Antonioni’s masterpiece changed the course of Italian neorealism and arthouse cinema. It injected a healthy dose of entropy into conventions of European cinema, where plot and story lost their preeminence, replaced by the potential of a searching, introverted, filmic gaze.” <strong>Kaya Genc</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When I first saw L’avventura, at film university, it made me contemplate the idea that a filmmaker could be deliberately obtuse, vague, mystifying, and that it could work so entirely in creating a mood of alienation. Moving on to La notte (1961), Blow-Up (1966) and The Passenger (1975), this was an artist who epitomised the auteurist possibility of a singular cinematic vision structured across an entire body of work. I later saw a documentary on Antonioni in which he described himself as the proponent of the “cinema of miscommunication” – a statement as insightful as it was self-aware. Ironically, his central insight is the modernist breakdown of coherence and unity, in cinema and life. Also, Monica Vitti.” <strong>Dario Llinares</strong></p>\r\n",

The result is the grandest science fiction film of the silent era (and for many years to come), a seminal prediction of a megacity where the masses work as slaves for the good of a ruling elite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DNA of huge swathes of sci-fi cinema is traceable in Lang’s production, from the mad-scientist creation of the robot Maria, which would feed into Hollywood’s Frankenstein (1931), to the imposing Art Deco cityscapes (ingeniously created using miniatures by Eugen Schüfftan), which became the model for later depictions of dystopian cities, from Blade Runner (1982) to Brazil (1985).

But the politics are the least of it – the film’s torrent of incredible and much-imitated imagery, aligned to its wild Freudian themes, is nothing less than an explosion of pure id on to the screen. Viewed as such, its absurdity is not a weakness, but a source of great strength. From its catacombs to its penthouses, Metropolis is the city of dreams.” <strong>Andrew Pope</strong></p>\r\n",

For writer-directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, it represented a triumphant attempt to create a ‘composed film’ in which music – here by Brian Easdale – plays a more central role, demanding similar expressive intensity in every detail of design and performance. Fittingly, it won Oscars for both art direction and music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s hard to think of many films that match The Red Shoes for ferocity and passion, since in every costume, set, and streak of grease paint there is desire. Moira Shearer’s performance as an ambitious ballerina is a tour de force. Jack Cardiff ’s moody colour work takes on a life of its own on screen. And the cinematography in the surreal extended dance sequence is breathtaking.

Chris Marker proves that a 30-minute film can be the intellectual and emotional equal of, or even superior to, the much bigger, longer, more lavish time-trip sci-fi movies that came in La Jetée’s wake.” <strong>Jane Giles</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Vividly recreating Russia at the time of the Tatar invasions, Andrei Tarkovsky’s fictionalised biography of the icon painter Andrei Rublev is a historical epic to rival Eisenstein’s Ivan the Terrible trilogy of the 1940s. In a frightening and barbaric medieval world, the wandering artist has his faith, and his faith in his art, sorely tested by the hellish brutalities he is confronted with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conceived on a vast scale, the film features several awe-inspiring set-pieces, including its opening hot-air balloon flight and the climatic casting of a giant bell. Though he shot in black and white, Tarkovsky switches to colour for the final montage of Rublev’s paintings. The film fell foul of the Soviet authorities and was not released domestically until 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Among filmmakers, one of the paradigmatic cases of indomitable entrepreneurial spirit was Andrei Tarkovsky. For each of his films he had conflicts with the Soviet State Committee for Cinematography, to the point that, from 1982, his films, which triumphed in festivals around the world, were no longer screened in the Soviet Union and his name was never again mentioned in the state-controlled media. Andrei Rublev, especially the episode entitled ‘The Bell’, can be seen as a hymn to creative freedom; to the innovator as a window to creativity that opens in societies; and to courage and risk-taking as two of the fundamental characteristics that anyone who intends to transform the world must have.” <strong>Santiago Navajas</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The hand of man moved by the hand of God.” <strong>Toni Dimkov</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Everybody comes to Rick’s bar, including expat Rick’s (Humphrey Bogart) former lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), in one of Hollywood’s most-loved romantic melodramas. Set in Vichy-controlled Morocco during WWII, Casablanca revolves around a nightclub run by cynical American expat Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), where resistance fighters, immigrants and Nazis converge to police or partake in an illicit economy. In this colourfully exotic setting, created entirely on the Warner Bros studio lot, an affair is rekindled between Rick and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), the latter now the wife of a resistance leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Directed by Hungarian refugee Michael Curtiz, Casablanca exemplifies the consummately crafted Hollywood drama, in which all the elements seem to have fallen alchemically into place. The screenplay sparkles with memorable lines, the supporting cast overflows with indelible performances, and the whole is given an urgent, topical edge by being made on the cusp of America’s involvement in the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Conventional wisdom holds that by the early 1940s, the Hollywood studio system was a well-oiled machine. In this case, it was as if the Model T assembly line had produced a Rolls-Royce.” <strong>Peter Debruge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman put in performances that would define both of their careers. It was a match made in heaven. Also, it was a love story doomed from the very beginning.” <strong>Danielle Solzman</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The first time I remember falling head over heels in love with film – and with Ingrid Bergman.” <strong>Clara Bradbury-Rance</strong></p>\r\n",

Encountering a British military policeman (Trevor Howard) and Lime’s girlfriend (Alida Valli), Martins is forced to reassess both his friend and his own world view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Third Man is a consummate production, from Graham Greene’s witty, disturbing screenplay to Robert Krasker’s evocatively skewed photography and Anton Karas’ unforgettable zither score. But, despite his minimal screen time, Orson Welles’ amoral Harry Lime steals the show – thanks partly to the famous ‘cuckoo clock’ speech penned by Welles himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A film of shrewdly chosen detail, with even the smallest bit-part perfectly cast. Welles doesn’t even appear until more than an hour in and is on screen for barely 15 minutes, but his spirit dominates the action. It’s aptly set (and shot) in the shattered city of Vienna, its professional charm worn perilously thin, its once grand buildings now shabby and tottering. Anton Karas’s solo zither score vividly captures the wheedling, brittle mood of the defeated city.” <strong>Philip Kemp</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>The ascension of Julie Dash’s Daughters of the Dust to recognition as one of the greatest films of all time hardly comes as a surprise to Black women moviegoers, who championed the film from its earliest screenings and fiercely defended it against wilful misunderstandings in the decades that followed. Black women, in whose image the 1991 feature was directly created, saw then what is now widely understood: Dash’s visionary visual marriage between Afrocentric aesthetics and the rich emotional depth of Black womanhood is a cinematic triumph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daughters rapidly engulfs you with the lush, matriarchal world of the Peazant family, residing in South Carolina’s Sea Islands at the turn of the 20th century. The fundamental crisis takes shape as the women-centred family is split between migrating north or staying in the South Carolina Lowcountry. Dash’s multilayered narrative unfolds by allowing the youngest member of the clan, an unborn child, and the eldest members, the ancestors, to weigh in, in an energetic display of shared narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through a union of African diasporic storytelling techniques, visually arresting imagery (assisted by cinematographer and co-producer Arthur Jafa) and dynamic character scope, Daughters offers a deep reading of how ancestry and the depth of Black souls are fractured between a longing for modernity and tending to their roots. As the women try to work towards a collective solution and honour their individual paths,&nbsp;Dash invites us through their interiority. By doing so, we are granted access to the cinematic language of Black women defining themselves for themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film, which recently celebrated its 30th anniversary, remains an enduring symphony that sings, reframes and reignites a Black girl’s song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By refusing a Eurocentric understanding of African-American identity, Dash’s seminal work challenges us all to believe in cinema’s creation – and viewing – as an act of communal healing. With this cinematic heirloom leading the way, may we all continue to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Maya S. Cade</strong></p>\r\n",

Leaving behind his small-scale, realism-rooted dramas of the 50s, this episodic story of a tabloid reporter’s comings and goings within the decadent upper reaches of modern Italian society found Fellini moving in a flamboyant new direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film’s atmosphere of moral lassitude, together with its then scandalous sexual frankness, created a popular sensation, introducing the world to the word paparazzi. Together with Antonioni’s L’avventura (1960), its modernity of form and subject matter ushered Italian arthouse cinema into the 1960s. The image of Anita Ekberg cavorting in the Trevi fountain is one of the era’s most iconic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Socially and historically a landmark film, sensing, influencing and ambivalently critiquing the role of media, gossip, hedonism and celebrity in modern culture – but all done with brio, scale and complexity achieved with an astonishing lightness of touch, utterly confident in itself as cinema.” <strong>Richard Dyer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sprawling, infuriating, profoundly inventive – a film world populated by beautiful and sinister creatures that never ceases to surprise.” <strong>Belén Vidal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“An acrid romp through a demi-monde choking to death on its own ennui-fuelled excess. We’re all still being deadened by the same cultural hollowness depicted here, just without any of the glamour, our present as garish and frightful as that fish on the beach. If you’re gonna overdose on beauty, you might as well have Anita Ekberg around.” <strong>Charles Bramesco</strong></p>\r\n",

While there is endless debate as to which is the funniest of Buster Keaton’s 1920s features, there’s little doubt as to which is the cleverest. Anticipating Jean-Luc Godard and postmodernism by decades, the detective fantasy Sherlock Jr. largely takes place inside the head of a hapless and wronged cinema projectionist (Keaton) who – in a sequence that’s a technical marvel to this day – dreams himself into the screen only to be flummoxed by the film’s editing. But that’s merely one relatively early set-piece out of dozens, including a stunt so dangerous that it broke Keaton’s neck – something he wouldn’t discover until a routine medical examination over a decade later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Always a fan of film technology, Keaton here pushes film special effects to their then limits, though some of the most effective moments make use of old-fashioned vaudeville stage mechanics – such as the moment when he leaps “through” his disguised assistant to evade pursuers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A clockwork machine of craftmanship, Sherlock Jr. is Keaton at his best. Precise gag construction, lots of laughs and a personal point of view make this film not only one of the best comedies of all time, but also an early reflection on the role of cinema and storytelling in our personal lives.” <strong>Paula Feliz-Didier</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Few captured the majesty of our cinema dream-life as well as Buster Keaton. Here, the movie is the movie is the movie. That each of us could enter and indulge in a redemptive dream life was the tacit promise of the medium and Buster made good on that promise with pathetic nobility.” <strong>Steve Seid</strong></p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, he hopes to catch the eye of the sassy elevator girl, Fran Kubelik (Shirley Maclaine).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deliriously funny, The Apartment is also shot through with Wilder’s customary wit and cynicism, creating a bleak vision of estrangement in the modern working city. Celebrated art director Alexander Trauner designed the cavernous open-plan office. The film won five Academy Awards, including best picture and best director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m still not sure if it’s really a romantic comedy or a heartbreaking film about loneliness.

Declared the greatest film of all time at the 1958 Brussels World’s Fair and one of the only films to have appeared on all of Sight and Sound’s critics’ polls (1952 to 2022), Battleship Potemkin has also been widely censored, as much out of fear of the perceived influence of its ideas as for any contentious material on screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In essence, it tells a five-part story of a naval mutiny leading to full-blown revolution, but while this material could be crudely propagandist in other hands, Eisenstein uses images of such dynamic compositional strength and editing of such frame-perfect precision that it’s hard not to be swept along, regardless of personal politics. Despite endless quotation and parody, the set-piece massacre on the Odessa Steps still packs a sledgehammer punch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No other film in the history of cinema has had such a revolutionary impact.” <strong>Ian Aitken</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Historically, Battleship Potemkin is unsurpassed in its impact. The perfect blend of aesthetic and social commitment, of the collective and the individual, of thought and emotion.” <strong>Eithne O’Neill</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A factory for some of the most iconic images in the medium’s history, which aim at doing nothing less than obliterating and reconfiguring our vision of the world and our commitment to transforming it. Eisenstein equally reveals himself to be a committed sensualist and wit: who can watch this film and not appreciate its desirous, homoerotic gaze?” <strong>James Leo Cahill</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>One of cinema’s most vividly realised dystopias, the Los Angeles of Blade Runner is a nightmare cityscape of towering skyscrapers, vast advertising holograms and perpetual rain. Three years after the deep-space horror of Alien (1979), Ridley Scott imagined an urban future to rival Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. The ghost of Raymond Chandler’s bygone LA haunts its story of a Marlowe-like former detective (Harrison Ford) assigned to track down escaped ‘replicants’ – biologically engineered beings employed as slaves by their human masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially a critical and commercial flop, Blade Runner developed a huge cult following. Countless science-fiction blockbusters have tried to replicate it, but Scott’s original retains an unrepeatable intrigue in the central ambiguity of Deckard’s own identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Science-fiction cinema is transformed forever in the furnace of production design.” <strong>Nigel Andrews</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Blade Runner distils the iconographies of dystopian science-fiction and transmogrifies them to produce the blueprint for seemingly every example of the genre to follow. As we have moved into the digital age and passed 2019, the year the film is set, Blade Runner’s analogue materiality now looks thoroughly retro-dystopian. But our deepest anxieties about the integrity of the self, our technology-constituted experience, environmental apocalypse and a polarised society in extremis have never felt more relevant.” <strong>Dario Llinares</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Lawrence G. Paull’s cityscapes, Jordan Cronenweth’s cinematography, Vangelis’s electronic score and Rutger Hauer’s soulful android were all astonishing innovations that redefined movie sci-fi.” <strong>Andy Lea</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Working with his biggest budget to date, Jean-Luc Godard created a sublime widescreen drama about marital breakdown, set during pre-production on a film shoot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Famously, producer Carlo Ponti was disappointed that Jean-Luc Godard’s adaptation of the Alberto Moravia’s novel A Ghost at Noon contained no nude shots of star Brigitte Bardot. With typical perversity, Godard compromised by adding an explicit scene of Camille (Bardot) naked on a bed as screenwriter-husband Paul (Michel Piccoli) lists her attractive features. The anecdote is appropriate for a film that features an American film producer (Jack Palance) exerting his crass influence over the Grecian epic being made by German genius Fritz Lang (playing himself).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While filled with playful cinematic references, Le Mépris is perhaps Godard’s most emotionally direct film, particularly intense in the long central apartment scene – masterfully shot by Raoul Coutard – in which the fractures in Paul and Camille’s marriage come to seem irreversible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Godard’s finest film is a deeply cynical study of the loss of artistic integrity and the loss of respect that comes from it, a warning to every artist who chooses to sell out for financial gain.” <strong>David Flint</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The ideal balance between a Godard work’s self-reflexivity and its penchant for the elegiac and transcendent. It’s at once a send-up of the institution of cinema and, somehow, a meditation on love and art’s profound mysteries.” <strong>Rielle Navitski</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The schematic beauty of the colours and the detached acting of the actors, in contrast to the lyricism of the music, make Le Mépris an obsessive story.” <strong>François Jost</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Long before The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion explored the relationship between sexuality and power with this Palme d’Or-winning tale of a woman, mysteriously mute, arriving with her daughter for an arranged marriage in 19th-century New Zealand, and getting caught up in a strange arrangement with her husband’s neighbour. The titular musical instrument is both bargaining tool and an outlet for private passions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So hard to choose just one Jane Campion film, but The Piano still resonates for me and hits the sweet spot thanks to an unbeatable combination of talents, from Campion herself and the stars to Michael Nyman’s transcendent compositions.” <strong>Leslie Felperin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Piano is a film about passion and love for life, for music, for the essence. It is about the clash between form and content, love and possession, illusion and triviality. It is about uncompromising will and the choice to live one’s own way, at any cost.” <strong>Suncica Unevska</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The image of Ada (Holly Hunter) on the beach, a black umbrella in her hand, her daughter on her lap, her piano on the sand, is unforgettable. Every shot in this film evokes painting. Every image is a shock. We go through all the emotions: it is a tortured film, a tale about emancipation, passion, fantasies.” <strong>Ava Cahen</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A complex masterpiece full of cinematic language that reflects how women’s rights in the world can be applied to contemporary society.” <strong>Anchalee Chaiworaporn</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Jane Campion is arguably one of the few directors who has managed to engender a new humanist vision for cinema at the point of modernity’s decline. Her Piano is a vaccine that has helped cinema’s relevance survive well into the 21st century.” <strong>Vigen Galstyan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One of the most visceral film experiences I had as an 11-year-old moviegoer and the impression has stayed intact. Hunter’s performance and Stuart Dryburgh’s cinematography are something from another world.” <strong>Bruno Oseguera Pizaña</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Piano is a film that springs to mind every time I find myself on a rainy beach or with a hole in my tights. Two hours of perfect, voluptuous repression and desire.” <strong>Nazmia Jamal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oceanic cinema at its most all-consuming: a singular, senses-stunning wave of eroticism entwined with tragedy, played out on a canvas that demands the biggest screen while piercing the heart with tiny details. You feel something new with each viewing. Campion is also a pioneer in the field of showcasing male nudity in mainstream film, redressing a sexist imbalance that has diminished the artform for decades (and continues to do so). Absolutely wild it didn’t make the top 100 in the critics’ or directors’ poll last time!” <strong>Manish Agarwal</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Together with the first films of Jean-Luc Godard and Claude Chabrol, both former colleagues of François Truffaut at the film journal Cahiers du Cinéma, the release in 1959 of this lyrical tale of childhood heralded the arrival of a younger generation of French filmmakers who would revitalise their staid national cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dedicated to André Bazin – co-founder of Cahiers du Cinéma and a champion of personal filmmaking – and made in the expressive, spontaneous spirit of 1930s director Jean Vigo, Truffaut’s film introduced his errant alter ego, Antoine Doinel (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud). Among Truffaut’s stylistic innovations, the most celebrated is the final freeze-frame which fixes Antoine’s expression as, having made a break for liberty, he gazes back into the camera, his future heartbreakingly uncertain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Respected, revered and taught in the academic curricula for a long time, the impression of The 400 Blows is one of your elders’ masterpieces you need to bear. Yet the film itself stubbornly defies all such preconditions, with its audacity, sincerity and the honesty of a kid who doesn’t want to be treated as a kid; cinema grows up as a result.” <strong>Vassilis Kroustallis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Simply the greatest coming-of-age story in film history.” <strong>Elena Smolina</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Cinema as sanctuary.” <strong>Sukhdev Sandhu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The 400 Blows is one of the greatest films to ever describe that angst towards life, family and societal hierarchical structures.” <strong>Nicola Marzano</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Ordet was the only film Carl Theodor Dreyer directed during the two decades between Two People (1945) and his final film, Gertrud (1964). With Gertrud, it represents the apotheosis of his controlled visual style, consisting of long, uninterrupted takes, with one shot often sufficing for an entire sequence. The 124-minute running time contains only 114 shots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film focuses on a devout parson and his three sons, the eldest of whom, Mikkel (Emil Hass Christensen), has rejected God altogether, while his sibling Johannes (Preben Lerdorff Rye) has had a breakdown and thinks himself to be Jesus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on a 1932 play by Kaj Munk, the material is transformed by Dreyer into uniquely slow, hypnotic cinema that examines the nature of believing. The ending ranks among the medium’s most beautiful and mysterious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This film is the high watermark of spiritual or transcendental cinema. Strangely atmospheric and exceptionally intense, Ordet ’s discomforting meditation on the nature of real faith is served by Dreyer’s masterful handling of camerawork, staging, physical detail and sound, and builds to a climax that is arguably the most astonishing and moving in all cinema.” <strong>Jonathan Owen</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s hard to think of another film that more exquisitely captures the perpetual heartbreak of being among other people, the distances of understanding that linger in the spaces between figures in a single shot. It literally takes a miracle to bring them together: a miracle made possible through cinema.” <strong>Kevin B. Lee</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Mise en scène as miracle.” <strong>Marco Müller</strong></p>\r\n",

Individual set-pieces are as gripping as any ever filmed, with Gillo Pontecorvo’s determination to give both sides a fair hearing leading to constant moral ambiguity when both sides commit tit-for-tat atrocities. Although there’s no doubt where the film itself stands (it was independent Algeria’s first production), the most richly drawn character is the French Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), aware that he’s on history’s losing side but still required to go through the motions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially banned in France, Pontecorvo’s film has been used as a morale-booster by both the Black Panther movement and the 2010 Algerian World Cup team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Unquestionably the greatest political film ever made, and by such a wide margin that it’s hard to think of an obvious runner-up. Riveting as a suspense thriller and rigorously clear-eyed in its presentation of atrocities committed by both sides. It’s uncannily relevant to this day in its forensically detailed explanation not merely of the reasons why Western occupation of the Middle East is always doomed to failure but also exactly how terrorist cells operate, both then and now.” <strong>Michael Brooke</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Following the collapse of his long-gestating Napoleon project, Stanley Kubrick turned to this lesser-known novel by the author of Vanity Fair, set at the time of the Seven Years War. Famed for his perfectionism, Kubrick went to extraordinary lengths to research and recreate the look of the period, taking inspiration from the era’s great visual stylists, painters such as Thomas Gainsborough and William Hogarth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Determined to film by natural or historically accurate light sources, Kubrick and his cinematographer John Alcott acquired super-fast lenses to capture scenes lit only by candles. The pristine, painterly look of the finished film was decried by some critics, who found the amoral escapades of the title character (Ryan O’Neal) emotionally uninvolving. Barry Lyndon’s reputation has soared in the years since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sublime and elusive, Barry Lyndon is Kubrick’s most sad, mysterious and misleading work – flickering like the candlelight by which some of it was famously lit.” <strong>Elena Smolina</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Mournful, funny and exquisitely beautiful, the film that puts the lie to the notion of Kubrick being cold and unfeeling.” <strong>Sean Hogan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In Kubrick’s opulent presentation, Thackeray’s opportunist is not only a still-living caricature of many of us, but also, above all, a merciless image of a society based on innate and hereditary superiority.” <strong>Michal Kriz</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The most beautiful film about the triumph of human ambition and then its decadence, made by cinema’s mightiest hermit.” <strong>Michel Lipkes</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p> It’s hard to believe there was a time when Killer of Sheep wasn’t widely recognized as a canonical work. The operative word however, is widely: it got great reviews from its moment of premiere in 1978. So why the recognition gap? In some ways it’s a story that parallels the film itself: it simply lacked the cultural benefits of more privileged contemporary productions.  Killer of Sheep was made on shoestring while writer/director Charles Burnett was still a student at UCLA, studying under luminaries including Basil Wright and Elyseo Taylor. Despite the looming presence of Hollywood, Burnett found inspiration in the Italian Neorealist films he saw in class, and defying expectations, adapted the department’s resources to tell tales of a previously undocumented America: everyday lives amongst the black community he knew in East Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But just as the film’s subjects were in a sense ghetto-ized, so was the film. Without funds available music rights couldn’t be cleared, and the film spent several decades as highly lauded marginalia. I first saw it in a poor-quality 16mm print in the mid 1980’s: the only way it could be seen at the time. The picture was soft and the dialogue muffled, leaving me with the memory of a feeling as much as anything else. It wasn’t till I was fortunate to restore the film for the UCLA Film & Television Archive in the early 2000’s – when improved laboratory techniques allowing Burnett’s brilliant photography and dialogue to emerge – that I realized its true genius. The visionary team at Milestone Films concurred, going through Herculean battles to clear the music rights, and launched its first international 35mm release in 2007, a full thirty years after its completion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly wide audiences throughout the world were seeing scenes that have since been etched forever in our collective memory: young children filmed from below as the leap across the gap between tenement rooftops; a hard-won car engine teetering precariously on the edge of a departing truck, the sad lonely dance of slaughterhouse worker Henry Sanders and his wife, Kaycee Moore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon the restoration’s premiere, I was occasionally fortunate to present the film with Charles in attendance, and would introduce him not as one of America’s “great black directors” but rather as one of the “great American directors.”  It’s true he’s spent a career championing black lives in his storytelling, but I always felt the former term was not enough, and implied a privileging the work decried. Now I think it’s probably time to omit the true but limiting  American descriptor as well: he’s simply one of “the world’s great directors.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ross Lipman</strong></p>\r\n",

That lengthy trolley-car ride early on is like a ferry across the River Styx, or the moment in sleep between the real world blurring away and the appearance of the counterfeit images that our brains manifest.

In this case, the mystery relates to the murder of a samurai and the rape of his wife in 11th century Japan, events which are relayed in wildly differing versions by those present: the bandit, the treacherous wife, a passing woodcutter and the spirit of the dead samurai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This radically non-linear structure, with its profound implications about the fallibility of perspective, impressed judges at the 1951 Venice Film Festival. They awarded Akira Kurosawa’s film the Golden Lion, helping to encourage a broader interest in Japanese film in the west. With its snaking bolero-like score and poetic use of dappled forest light, Rashomon is a work of enduring ambiguity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What is the truth – the perceived, or the real? What is justice?

Like the wartime trilogy that Roberto Rossellini began with Rome: Open City (1945), it heralded a new kind of cinematic naturalism, employing non-professionals as actors and taking the camera out onto the streets to faithfully record the social realities of a Europe struggling to get back on its feet after WWII.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adapted from a novel by Luigi Bartolini, the quiet tragedy of a father’s desperate hunt for a stolen bicycle that he depends on for his work has a fable-like simplicity. For all its vivid documentation of a downtrodden Rome, it is as a universal tale of human striving that De Sica’s film has proved influential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Bicycle Thieves not only embodies both aesthetically and politically the most important features of the Italian neorealist movement but also, with De Sica’s use of non-professional actors, social engagement and firm roots in the fabric of society, paved the way for hybridity in film and therefore the so-called ‘cinema of the real’.” <strong>Nico Marzano</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This painfully beautiful chronicle of life in post-World War II Rome salvages views of rundown streets, poverty and injustice with such precision and simplicity that the emotional punch of the finale is unparalleled.” <strong>Kaya Genç</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The gold standard for all human films about inequality.” <strong>Andrei Liimets</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Billy Wilder’s zany cross-dressing comedy begins with a massacre – resembling the gangland St Valentine’s Day killings of 1929 – and ends with one of the most celebrated last lines in cinema history. Written in cahoots with the director’s new collaborator I.A.L. Diamond, Some Like It Hot ascends to inspired heights of silliness in-between, with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon both on career-best form as dragged-up musicians hiding out with Sugar Kane’s girl band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the gangster story and the screwball antics hark back to Hollywood films of the 1930s, but Wilder’s outrageous and subversive play with gender was truly boundary pushing and helped lead to a loosening of censorship after United Arists released the film without certification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sensationally funny, one of the best scripts ever, Marilyn Monroe at the peak of her incandescence, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon beyond brilliant in drag and some great songs. How can anyone not love this?” <strong>Alan Jones</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I was about to write about the richly coded and deceptively generous queerness of Billy Wilder’s immortal cross-dressing comedy, but I also shouldn’t overcomplicate things: it’s here because it has always made me laugh like nothing else, and still does.” <strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Nobody’s perfect. Nobody but Billy Wilder.” <strong>Fabio Troncarelli</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Comedies are always underrated in this poll. This is a masterpiece of its genre, one of the funniest films ever made. Wonderful actors, wonderful tempo, wonderful dialogue.” <strong>Barbara Schweizerhof</strong></p>\r\n",

While the opening scenes – when a schoolgirl is ominously presented with a balloon by a stranger in silhouette – create an atmosphere of dread, daringly the director later establishes the killer Hans Beckert as a figure of pathos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lang is more concerned with a clinical examination of the cross-section of Berlin society – the politicians, the businessmen, the organised criminals – whose self-serving interests are compromised by Beckert’s freedom. Lorre’s creepy, bulging-eyed performance as the killer who can’t help himself quickly attracted the attention of Hollywood, where he made a career playing sinister desperados.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The greatest of the early talkies.” <strong>Andreas Kilb</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“M is a dark symphony about Berlin at the dawn of the 20s. A whole era is reflected on the face of one man – a man suffering from “a social evil”, as Lang would say. Hans Beckert, the character played by Peter Lorre, meets the fury of the crowd; they are about to lynch him. But Lang is always on the side of those who try to understand human behaviour.” <strong>Miquel Escudero Diéguez</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A film that interrogates the complex, ambiguous nature of the human soul and notions of law and justice, with a mise en scène of rare stylistic perfection that combines German expressionism with the absolute power of offscreen and sound.” <strong>Giulio Casadei</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A lively, important work from the early sound era, its ingenious use of audio technique is still worth examining today.” <strong>Zhang Ling</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>By 1931 talkies were the industry norm, but Chaplin was autonomous enough to be able to make City Lights silent, preferring the purity of mute pantomime for the antics of his iconic Tramp character. Despite this anachronism, the result was a huge success with audiences, who responded to the film’s exquisitely poised balancing act between humour and pathos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earnestly sentimental in its story of the downtrodden Tramp being mistaken for a wealthy benefactor by a blind and impoverished flower girl (Virginia Cherrill), the film nonetheless yields some of Chaplin’s most ingenious comic set-pieces, including a classic sequence in which the Tramp becomes an unwilling contestant in the boxing ring. The closing shot, after it dawns on the girl who her sponsor really was, counts among the cinema’s most moving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The balance between humour and drama that’s so effective in [Charlie] Chaplin’s work has its roots not just in his undoubted talent but in the real sympathy he felt for characters on the fringes of society. He saw rich dramaturgical material in the dreams, love, disappointments and pains of such people, but he never lost sight of the humanity and complexity of a stratum of society often defined in fiction more by its financial conditions than by its wellsprings of individuality and sensitivity. City Lights is, in those respects, the best example of his best traits.” <strong>Pablo Villaça</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One of the most beautiful films about seeing (and being seen).” <strong>Miquel Escudero Diéguez</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Chaplin’s romcom embodies all the magic and power of cinema; it’s both awe-inducing and ‘aww’-inducing. The emotional drive of the narrative and the creativity of its slapstick continue to inspire filmmakers.” <strong>Courtney Howard</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Bengali film director Satyajit Ray was inspired by the example of Italian neo-realist films such as Bicycle Thieves (1948) to make his own low-budget, open-air drama painting a naturalistic portrait of ordinary lives. Encouraged by Jean Renoir, whom he assisted during the filming of The River (1951), Ray set to work on an adaptation of a 1929 novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay about a young boy growing up in an impoverished rural community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Distinct from the more commercial Hindi films of the time, Pather Panchali announced the arrival of a humanistic, Calcutta-centred Indian art cinema, ultimately paving the way for the emergence of the Parallel Cinema movement of the 1960s. Among the film’s intensely memorable moments is a scene in which Apu (Subir Banerjee) and his sister run through a paddy field to catch a glimpse of a passing train.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Here is a cinema of awakenings.” <strong>Sukhdev Sandhu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A tour de force of humanist cinema, looking at a rural family which faces tragedies as well as stolen moments of happiness and togetherness. The influence of Jean Renoir, coupled with a fierce originality in its black-and-white visuals, still mark it out as the best Indian film ever made – and all achieved at a negligible budget.” <strong>Khalid Mohamed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ray’s classic was hailed internationally as a realist masterpiece but dismissed in India by some eminent citizens (who should have known better) as a film that did nothing but highlight Indian poverty for Western eyes. Looking at it today, you marvel at what Ray pulled off. He had a great sense of design and space, but to have created a film whose every frame captures time and place with such elegance and depth still takes you aback. To me, it is Indian cinema’s first truly modern film, at home in the world.” <strong>Shubhra Gupta</strong></p>\r\n",

Estranged by boredom, then separated when Juliette (Dita Parlo) flees for the excitements of Paris, the film visualises the lovers’ mutual longing with sensuous immediacy, as when Jean dives into the Seine and imagines his lost love in the water alongside him. Vigo’s open-air spontaneity and low-budget lyricism were a key influence on the French New Wave of the late 1950s and 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No one achieved more in less time than Jean Vigo – how would the history of cinema be different if he had lived past 29? L’Atalante remains raw, strange, radical and singular. You don’t watch it so much as you are immersed in it, swimming through visions like the lovesick barge captain when he plunges into the river in search of his lost bride. No film embodies more fully and purely the inherent fluidity, surrealism, realism, eroticism and ghostliness of cinema.” <strong>Imogen Sara Smith</strong></p>\r\n",

The shower scene immediately comes to mind: the editing, the knife, the music, the lifeless eye of the heroine, the blood mixing with the water. It’s a truly terrifying sequence, even today.” <strong>Ava Cahen</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Andrei Tarkovsky drew on memories of a rural childhood before WWII for this personal, impressionistic and unconventional film poem. For perhaps his most daring experimentation with film structure, Andrei Tarkovsky intersperses scenes from three eras – a childhood in the countryside, the Great War, and post-war maturity – to create a prismatic reflection of his own life and those of his parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abandoning linear narrative in favour of dramatising discontinuous shards of memory (particularly relating to his mother Maria, played by Margarita Terekhova), Tarkovsky pioneered a poetic and richly allusive form. Wartime newsreel footage, self-consciously painterly compositions, indelible imagery (a field whipped suddenly by wind, a gas lantern flickering out), and the director’s mesmeric camera movements combine to create a work of cumulative, rhythmic effect. The soundtrack features music by Bach, and Tarkovsky’s father Arseny Tarkovsky reading from his own poetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’d think Mirror might be a heavy, intellectual film, but it is direct, even basic: remembering, childhood, loss, speculation… It talks to people not through words, but through images and emotions. Wonderfully shot and composed, it contains some of the most spectacular imagery ever captured on screen.” <strong>Barbara Schweizerhof</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A great reflection on Russian history through the eyes of Tarkovsky. Non-linear storytelling, dreamlike sequences, historical footage and much more… All this put together through amazing editing, influenced by shattered memories.” <strong>Hauvick Habéchian</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Federico Fellini triumphantly conjured himself out of a bad case of creative block with this autobiographical magnum opus about a film director experiencing creative block. After the popular and critical success of his state-of-the-nation paparazzi drama La dolce vita (1960), Federico Fellini found himself at an artistic impasse. The fog lifted when he turned to his own situation for inspiration, casting Marcello Mastroianni as his alter ego, famous Italian director Guido Anselmi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking its title from the number of films Fellini had completed up to this point (including some short segments for anthology films), 8½ features Guido being besieged by sycophants and collaborators as he struggles to get started on an unwieldy science-fiction epic. Frequently digressing into surreal and erotic dream sequences, Fellini’s self-reflexive movie about movie-making climaxes with an exuberant parade in which Guido directs the colourful cast of characters who have played supporting roles in his life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“8½ is a synthesis of modern cinema in terms of narrative invention and reflexivity. The filmmaker’s crisis allows for a glimpse of the doubts, weaknesses and ghosts involved in the creative process, calling into question the idea of an omniscient author secure in their métier. Fellini also develops a penetrating study of the artist’s psychology, projecting it on to his alter ego, played by Marcello Mastroianni. The film condenses several elements typical of the Fellinian universe, such as mass communication, the circus, the game of affections and the artificial world provided by art.” <strong>Carlos Alberto Mattos</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The best film about filmmaking ever made.” <strong>Bina Paul Venugopal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The character of Guido Anselmi (Mastroianni) is the perfect incarnation of the artist devoured by his demons, alone and helpless in front of his artwork.” <strong>Mustapha Benfodil</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>The eruption of Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire at 30th place, the highest new entry in the poll, mirrors the meteoric rise of a director who had just begun her career at the time of the last poll. Her first three films, Water Lilies (2007), Tomboy (2011) and Girlhood (2014), did much to redefine coming-of-age narratives, opening new horizons on youth and queer desire while manifesting a coherent stylistic vision, characterised notably by pareddown visuals. As a result, Sciamma, an alumna of the prestigious Paris film school La Fémis, swiftly rose to the pantheon of French auteur cinema (she scripts all her films). Unusually in the French context, she adroitly coordinated this cinephile pedigree with her lesbian identity and strongly articulated political – including feminist – positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portrait of a Lady on Fire brought Sciamma’s work and status to another level. Her first costume film, set on a remote Breton island in the late 18th century, charts in a series of exquisite tableaux the intense passion between two women, a painter, Marianne (Noémie Merlant), and her model Héloïse (Adèle Haenel). Héloïse is to be married against her will to a rich man on the strength of the portrait. After initial resistance on both women’s parts, the painting becomes the conductor for their love for each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Portrait, Sciamma fights patriarchal oppression first of all by creating a utopian, if temporary, all-women’s world. More fundamentally, the relationship between the two women develops as one of reciprocity and equality. The film thus rejects a hierarchical vision of desire and in the process updates the relationship between artist and model and the fetishised figure of the ‘muse’. Portrait’s egalitarian ethos evidently echoes Sciamma’s own commitment – among other things she is deeply involved in the Collectif 50/50, which fights for gender equality in the French film industry. But the film resonated with the ambient culture in other ways. When it came out in France in the autumn of 2019, Portrait appeared as the perfect illustration of the female gaze, a concept newly ‘discovered’ in a country that was still coming to terms, only slowly, with the aftermath of the #MeToo movement, about which both Sciamma and Haenel (formerly a couple) spoke out in various contexts. Portrait of a Lady on Fire demonstrates Sciamma’s ability to make a timelessly beautiful film that also crystallises the gender politics of her era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ginette Vincendeau</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Brought to vivid life by director Martin Scorsese – then one of Hollywood’s hot-property new filmmakers – the film is one of the 1970s’ most strikingly original works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the film is evocatively rooted in contemporary New York, Scorsese’s camera dwells on strange expressionistic details – such as the sulphurous, steaming sidewalk and abstract neon signs – that contribute to the film’s hallucinatory, nightmarish quality. Centred around a brilliant performance by Robert De Niro, the grim intensity of Bickle’s avenging mania is framed by Bernard Herrmann’s forceful and occasionally nostalgic score.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Political conspiracy, violence and queasy comedy – as fresh as it ever was.” <strong>Roger Luckhurst</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Following this cracked taxi driver through his nocturnal wanderings, we also follow his dark thoughts. In the maze of the city swarm so many lost and lonely souls exactly like our paranoiac protagonist – struggling for a kind of justice and running madly for an unreachable inner peace.” <strong>Mustapha Benfodil</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The modern template for post-war disillusionment and the brittle masculinities it produces. Setting the film in New York was a masterstroke: watching Bickle struggle to reintegrate into a city that seems in moral, spiritual freefall itself only makes his own predicaments all the sadder.” <strong>Kevin Wynter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A vivid love/hate letter to the history of American film.” <strong>Marten Blomkvist</strong></p>\r\n",

In their universe, nothing traditional is sacred: food, clothes, men and war become both ammunition and subject of their pranks. This provocative and timeless gem is a surrealist fever dream and begs the viewer to open their eyes to what is sacred to them.” <strong>Dorota Lech</strong></p>\r\n",

As such, it is one of the most important cinematic contributions of all time. The insistent and pervasive presence of the past in the present, nowhere more visible than in contemporary European and, for that matter, global conflicts, bears eloquent witness to Lanzmann’s timeless and visionary achievement.” <strong>Catherine Portuges</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m still in awe of what Lanzmann and his team were able to achieve: to show us the sheer evil that can be found within humanity.

      "fullDescription": "<p>It’s a tragedy for film history that Charles Laughton’s sole directorial effort was such a critical and commercial disaster that he never made another. An adaptation of Davis Grubb’s novel, the film is refined to a lucid allegory. Evil, in the form of fake preacher Robert Mitchum, is visited upon a woman and two innocent children until they’re rescued by Good, in the form of frail Lillian Gish. In its intensely visual treatment of the story it harks back to the great silent films, thanks to former Orson Welles collaborator Stanley Cortez’s marvellously expressive black-and-white cinematography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the former criminal convinced that his executed cellmate’s loot is in the possession of his widow (Shelley Winters) – whom he marries purely in order to get his hands on it – Mitchum was never better: charismatic and charming, vicious and violent, his symbolic ‘duel’ between two sets of tattooed knuckles (‘LOVE’ and ‘HATE’) provided American cinema with one of its indelible images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A mystical slice of Americana noir, this fable about the innate unreliability of adults and the tragic spectrum of human nature sticks in the memory like a stone in the craw. ‘It’s a hard world for the little things.’” <strong>Gemma Files</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Night of the Hunter knows just how unsettling the perversion of innocence can be, building on this premise to create a poisoned fairytale. With his only film, Laughton set out to film fear, and he succeeded.” <strong>Pedro Adrián Zuluaga</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Robert Mitchum was the master of the languid gaze, a couldn’tcare- less attitude that, in Laughton’s hands, made the allure of evil totally understandable. Shelley Winters’ Willa might have been a foolish woman for falling under the spell of the preacher with ‘love’ and ‘hate’ tattooed on his knuckles, but he offered her something otherwise unimaginable in her small Depression-era West Virginian town. Laughton’s masterpiece was immediately dismissed by audience and critics alike: its visual compositions led it to be suspected of artistry, while its refusal to conform to genre was box-office death. The dreamlike sequences of the children’s escape down the river viewed through an enormous spider’s web contrasted with the angular shadows of the light falling into their room, and all pathways lead to Lillian Gish’s final appearance, cradling a gun on the veranda as she waits, singing hymns, for Mitchum to come for his prey.” <strong>Ruth Barton</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Laughton’s career-length frustrations at cinema’s expressive limitations are here redeemed. A journey through the heart of darkness, in which heart and dark have equal weight – just as in Laughton’s acting.” <strong>James Swanton</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Animal protagonists are traditionally the preserve of sentimental stories for children, but while Robert Bresson’s tragic masterpiece about the travails of a donkey has the simple force of a fable, it presents a brutally pessimistic vision. Punished, maltreated, used, loved, Balthazar is put to work by one keeper after another, bearing silent witness to the folly and petty cruelties of his human masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bresson was a Catholic filmmaker, and his story has been interpreted as a Christian allegory by some critics. The director’s austerely concentrated shots, restricted to details of scenes in order to elucidate the whole, and his controlled use of sound to imply off-screen activity, make for a uniquely dense, richly textured film. Jean-Luc Godard was to suggest that Balthazar contained “the world in an hour and a half”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Bresson’s minimalist masterpiece brings to life with unequalled power the story of an abused donkey whose depth of suffering illuminates the cruelty of the human world towards other species and humanity’s unexamined belief in its own superiority.” <strong>Barbara Creed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The reverse of Disneyfication: a parable of animal sacrifice and the price of human foibles.” <strong>Barrett Hodsdon</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Robert Bresson drafted the rules of a new cinema and realised them in Au hasard Balthazar, his masterpiece. This seemingly aloof, cold film, inspired by a passage in Dostoevsky’s 1868 novel The Idiot, burns with a yearning for justice and beauty. Bresson’s disciplined portraiture of a donkey and the way of life in the French countryside is a lesson in seeing the world anew through the cinema and noticing the potential that endeavour contains.” <strong>Kaya Genc</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Few have changed the face of cinema like Bresson, proposing a wholly new understanding of cinematic time, performance, découpage and the fiction/nonfiction dichotomy. Au hasard Balthazar is the finest work to have ever shifted from the human to the non-human and back again.” <strong>Flavia Dima</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Bresson’s stillness is a limpid and natural act of consciousness in front of an impassive world. He stands at the heart of cinema.” <strong>Massimo Causo</strong></p>\r\n",

But this is no one-sided polemic: Lee’s characters (not least his own character Mookie) are all too recognisably human in their foibles and frailties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Spike Lee developed a street-smart cinematic language to create this vibrant portrait of a Brooklyn community.

As an adult, I visited Brooklyn, and Martin Luther King Jr and Malcolm X’s ideas resonated with me: they had been fighting for a cause similar to those my people, the Tamils, fought for with such brutality, in the north of Sri Lanka, in the face of genocide. In the 1983 riots in Colombo, our family home was burned to a crisp.

An office block of glass and steel becomes a boxed-in prison; a chaotic restaurant provides a memorably liberating opportunity for humanity to express itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Tati’s ruinously ambitious masterpiece starts as a satire of modern architecture and becomes a strangely beatific celebration of the way people move through public spaces. A film about minor embarrassments and fleeting connections between strangers, it begins in alienation and builds to a transcendent vision of communal harmony. Gruelling labour went into each seemingly effortless grace note, as Tati the performer drifts in aimless bewilderment through the world that Tati the director obsessively controls. In Playtime, the movie screen is an idealised public space in which Tati’s people demonstrate the joys of being one-dimensional.” <strong>Imogen Sara Smith</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There are plenty of films that offer a critique of technology and modernity. Yet, with his distinctive, meticulous mise en scène, which exploits depth of field in an unparalleled way, and his peculiar ‘downgrading’ of dialogue to a sound like any other, boosting the communicative role of the image, Tati does so in a unique and radical fashion.” <strong>Cristina Formenti</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One of the most ambitious films ever made.” <strong>Jai Arjun Singh</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>“Is this my favourite of the works of the great minimalist Ozu? You can summarise the plot of Late Spring in a couple of lines: the professor (Chishū Ryū) lives happily with his daughter Noriko; her aunt announces Noriko must marry before she is too old; the professor pretends he will marry so Noriko will not feel guilty about leaving him on his own. She marries. Even this is enough to understand that Ozu’s preoccupation with the precarity of happiness frames his greatest works. Just a glance – the professor’s at Mrs Miwa (Miyake Kuniko) during the Noh performance he attends with Noriko (Hara Setsuko) – is enough for a swirl of connections to run through Noriko’s mind. Ozu, who insisted on working over and over again with the same actors, knows that he need do nothing other than let his camera rest on Hara’s face and the slightest change of expression will tell us more than any words.” <strong>Ruth Barton</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m always startled when Tokyo Story (1953) gets named the ‘greatest Asian film’ when Ozu himself made one that strikes me as better – briefer, richer and more profoundly moving.” <strong>John Powers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“If I could pack Late Spring, Tokyo Story and Good Morning (1959) into one No. 1 spot, I would, but the first is the one I keep coming back to – it seems to hover so closely to the rhythms and regrets of ordinary life.” <strong>Ty Burr</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Deeply poignant and tender, yet restrained, dignified, almost stoic, it is narrated in Ozu’s typically minimalist style. Although it is difficult to pick just one from his extraordinary body of work, Late Spring was my first encounter with Ozu.” <strong>Nandana Bose</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A search for the balance between the part and the whole, at once profoundly sad and upliftingly heartwarming.” <strong>Sam Ho</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Silent cinema at its most sublimely expressive, Carl Theodor Dreyer’s masterpiece is an austere but hugely affecting dramatisation of the trial of St Joan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Released as talking pictures were already taking over, Carl Theodor Dreyer’s first film in France – the Danish master had previously worked in Scandinavia and Germany – is a remarkably distilled and refined example of silent storytelling. Based on the record of the 15th-century trial and execution of Joan of Arc, the film focuses on an extraordinarily concentrated central performance from Renée Falconetti, allegedly the result of merciless needling from Dreyer during the filming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Famous for its spare visual style, Dreyer’s film creates compelling drama from its looming facial close-ups, interspersing the plaintive Joan with the penetrating gazes of her zealous inquisitors. Watching the flickers of anguish and resolve across Falconetti’s features, registered in stark detail by Rudolph Maté’s cinematography, is one of cinema’s most purely moving experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Renée Falconetti gives the most impressive performance ever recorded on film in this silent classic. Carl Theodor Dreyer expanded the potential of the close-up in this chronicle of Joan of Arc’s trial and execution. This “hymn to the triumph of the soul over life”, as Dreyer called it, re-emerges in Vivre sa vie (1962), Jean-Luc Godard’s masterpiece, in which a devastated Anna Karina watches Joan’s pains in a film theatre and cries with her.” <strong>Kaya Genc</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I think it’s in the last decade that Dreyer’s somehow rapturously austere work of historical cinema shifted from being a film that enthralled me as a scholar to one that fully involved and moved me as a viewer – and of course, finally seeing it in an enveloping cinema environment, rather than a university lecture theatre or my own living room, was the instigating factor. You don’t absolutely need to see every crisply restored pore on Falconetti’s extraordinary face to viscerally feel her pain, but it certainly doesn’t hurt.” <strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Simply the best (silent) film about (silent) resistance.” <strong>Anton Dolin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A dream and a nightmare of spiritual ecstasy. Dreyer and his design collaborators create an amalgam of the 14th and 20th centuries, and somehow reach into the future with every stroke. Renée Falconetti’s performance: incomparable, unbeatable, anguished and enough to make an atheist think things over.” <strong>Michael Phillips</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A quote from Jean Epstein’s 1921 essay ‘Magnification’ is relevant here: ‘The close-up is an intensifying agent because of its size alone... whatever its numerical value, this magnification acts on one’s feelings more to transform than to confirm them, and personally, it makes me uneasy... The close-up modifies the drama by the impact of proximity. Pain is within reach. If I stretch out my arm I touch you, and that is intimacy. I can count the eyelashes of this suffering. I would be able to taste the tears.‘” <strong>Anne Gjelsvik</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Rice farmers hire a band of samurai to defend them against marauding bandits in Akira Kurosawa’s influential epic, a touchstone for action movies ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Akira Kurosawa followed the breakthrough international acclaim for Rashomon (1950) and Ikiru (1952) with this three-and-a-half-hour jidaigeki (period drama) set during Japan’s turbulent 16th century. Strongly influenced by the poetic westerns of John Ford, Kurosawa’s story of farmers recruiting a motley troupe of samurai to help them fend off bandits in turn had a huge impact on subsequent westerns and action films – from Hollywood remake The Magnificent Seven (1961) onwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The early section’s gathering together of the diversely talented fighters is a trope in action movies to this day, while the restrained use of slow-motion in the frenzied final faceoff has since been abused to far less subtle ends. Kurosawa expertly sustains the suspense over a lengthy duration, instilling the story with an almost Shakespearian grandeur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So ambitious and successful in its ambition that it seems to embody the most exciting aspects of the cinematic medium: epic sweep, not of place but of classes, from samurai to peasant to bandit to outsider; stunning photography that recreates 16th-century Japan, from its beautiful heights (the flower-picking scene) to its muddy depths (the final, agonising battle); wonderful performances, not only by Mifune Toshirō as the intense outsider who yearns to be a samurai, but also by Shimura Takashi as the samurai’s canny, world-weary leader and the finefeatured Miyaguchi Seiji, whom I refer to as Cool Old Guy. And with a moving, indeed shattering finale that suggests the sorrow of war both on the personal and on the historical side.” <strong>Susan Napier</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My list is light on epics, in part because depth of character impresses me more than scope. But Kurosawa gives us both.” <strong>Peter Debruge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Exciting and moving, its handling of characters and story makes it maybe the best film school that cinema has to offer.” <strong>Mårten Blomkvist</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When I was a kid, I watched an episode of the TV programme Movie Masterclass (1988), presented by Mamoun Hassan, that analysed this film’s framing, movement and editing, scene by scene. It blew my mind. Decades on, Kurosawa’s dynamism still leads the way.” <strong>Leigh Singer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Because Kurosawa transcended action cinema even as he invented it. Because he made it rain and rain. And because of his gaggle of ohso- human heroes: Shimura, Inaba, Katō, Miyaguchi, Chiaki, Kimura – and Mifune Toshirō like a cat on a hotplate.” <strong>Ian Nathan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Seven Samurai reminds us how moving pictures move. The whole film celebrates thrilling energy with compassion and empathy for the underprivileged.” <strong>Peggy Chiao</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The intricacy, ferocity and poignancy of Seven Samurai enable it to define a genre.” <strong>Katie Smith-Wong</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Kurosawa is Eisenstein’s principal heir and the genius of Japanese cinema.” <strong>Joan Mellen</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The eastern to top all westerns. Kurosawa’s absolute highlight and a film to be studied in terms of blending the exterior and the interior, the grand and the small, the there-and-then and the timeless.” <strong>Andrei Liimets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sixty-eight years after its release, Kurosawa’s masterpiece still defines everything that I want an action film to possess – a meaningful story with deep characterisations, beautiful shots and purposeful action, and a rhythm that immerses me in its every moment. There are very few action films that achieve this tapestry and Seven Samurai remains the best of them all.” <strong>Richard Propes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Kurosawa’s samurai epic marked a peak in the influential Japanese filmmaker’s most critically appreciated period. Together with star Mifune Toshirō, theirs was a collaboration which produced 17 years of films that belong in any catalogue of the greatest films ever made.” <strong>Tambay Obenson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Where would cinema be without Kurosawa Akira?” <strong>James Harrison</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Transplanting the story of Joseph Conrad’s colonial-era novel Heart of Darkness to Vietnam, Francis Ford Coppola created a visually mesmerising fantasia on the spectacle of war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shy of controversy, Hollywood steered clear of tackling the war in Vietnam until the conflict was over. In the late 1970s, emboldened by the critical successes of his two Godfather films, Francis Ford Coppola famously spent a vast amount of time and money in the jungles of Southeast Asia to bring to life the story of an American officer (Martin Sheen), sent up river to bring the wayward, megalomaniac Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) to ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The troubled production – beset by a typhoon, a heart attack (Sheen’s) and the perils of excess – has entered film-making lore, but the resulting film rivals Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 (1968) for its hallucinatory visuals and grandness of conception. Coppola defined its uniquely unhinged genius best: “My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This raw, ragged Vietnam War epic remains Coppola’s most ambitious and original work. It doesn’t have the classical poise of The Godfather (1972) but offers so much more in its impressionistic, wild-ride, river-road-movie journey, a post-60s version of Joseph Conrad’s novella Heart of Darkness (1899). The set pieces, music and performances are exemplary. This is haunting, ravishing cinema on a rare size and scale.” <strong>Adrian Wootton</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Apocalypse Now is cinema in its purest form.” <strong>Pablo Scholz</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“With innovative sound design by the threetime Oscar-winning genius Walter Murch, Apocalypse Now tells the story of a journey into the Cambodian jungle by US Special Forces Captain Willard (Martin Sheen). His mental and physical mission, to “terminate” the dangerously lawless Colonel Kurtz, who has set himself up as the god of a local tribe, soon becomes a process of self-discovery, ending with an outstanding, memorable performance from Marlon Brando.” <strong>Nico Marzano</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The insanity of war has seldom been portrayed so vividly.” <strong>Christian Monggaard</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This is a film about the hell of war and the lost meaning of glory through that journey into the abyss. It’s about agony, misery and the fall of concepts, principles and ideals. All this is achieved with such visual and poetic power. Each sequence speaks volumes on the human (or rather inhuman) condition, through the main character and all who surround him. These sequences are not necessarily present to develop the story, but to give the audience samples and examples of what it’s all about to be in hell.” <strong>Mohammed Rouda</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The greatest war movie ever made, Apocalypse Now will leave you shaking. No other film has explored the human soul quite like this one.” <strong>Emily Murray</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Vittorio Storaro's cinematography on Apocalypse Now imbues me with a sense of awe – that image of a fat, bald Brando swallowed up by impermeable darkness as he intones cryptic aphorisms, this jungle sage, this mad god.” <strong>Greg Cwik</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Perhaps the most perfect rendition of parallel internal and external journeys that I have ever seen.” <strong>Naman Ramachandran</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Coppola is one of the greatest film artists and I could submit a top-five-of-all-time list composed solely of his films.” <strong>Yael Shuv</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Ingmar Bergman’s Persona can be seen as the apex of his cinematic career – at one point in the film, even the celluloid itself appears to burn up in the projector, as if there was nowhere further to go. Like his Italian counterpart Fellini, Bergman achieved fame in European art cinema in the 1950s and early 60s but unexpectedly made his masterpiece out of a creative crisis. After the collapse of a project focusing on two actresses, Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann (who both had intimate relationships with the director), Bergman spent time in hospital, where he came up with a fresh idea. Struck by the women’s physical likeness, he planned to explore questions of identity through the encounter between a great stage actress (Ullmann) who has inexplicably fallen silent and the insecure, garrulous nurse (Andersson) assigned to look after her. Secluded on the barren island of Fårö (which became Bergman’s favourite location and main home), the protagonists – both brilliantly played – engage in a battle of wills, their divergent attitudes towards sex and motherhood merging in disturbing ways. The erotic intensity and rawness of Persona was challenging in 1966, and remains so – few film ‘classics’ still feel so modern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any sense of a conventional psychodrama is constantly disrupted by the experimental, improvisatory nature of the filmmaking. Bergman begins the film with a violent, fractured opening montage illustrating the nature of cinema itself and keeps ratcheting up the ambiguities by blurring realism and fantasy. Self-reflexivity never seemed so seductive, as the film freely plays with ideas of public masks and inner secrets, vampirism physical and metaphysical, and the fine line between screen performance and real lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Persona has virtually defined the outer reaches of subsequent ‘art’ cinema, influencing visionary directors from Robert Altman and Nicolas Roeg to David Lynch and Olivier Assayas. Its iconography has become pervasive – Andersson’s cool blackrimmed sunglasses, the haunting images of the two women facing the camera, all beautifully rendered in the velvety monochrome photography of Sven Nykvist. The film’s overtly Jungian aspects and slippery narrative have provoked many questions and debates; Bergman gave little away, preferring audiences to draw their own conclusions. He followed Persona with some great films, but nothing quite as audacious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David Thompson</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>From the mid-1990s until his death in 2016, Abbas Kiarostami was widely regarded as one of the most original, innovative and important filmmakers around, an audacious, idiosyncratic artist with a profoundly humane but highly distinctive view of the world. Close-Up is often seen not only as a turning-point in the Iranian’s career – it cemented his confidence in blurring the distinction between ‘documentary’ and ‘fiction’ – but as the film most representative of his aims and achievements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could have been a straightforward record of the court case of an unemployed print worker accused of impersonating filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf with the intent of fraudulently obtaining money from a well-to-do family. But in relating the story of Hossein Sabzian’s encounter with the Ahankhahs, Kiarostami characteristically opts for anything but an obvious linear narrative. Mixing 16mm footage of the trial (in which Kiarostami himself seems to ask as many questions as the judge) with recreations of events performed by the family, Sabzian and others playing themselves, he fragments the story into diverse meandering strands that frequently frustrate expectations while still remaining intelligible and engrossing. ‘Important’ events may be left unseen; in their place, sequences in which nothing of any clear consequence happens. Re-enactments occur without giving away whose point of view they represent. The more ‘information’ we’re offered about the case, the more we come to realise that there are no easy answers to any of the questions being raised. The plot thickens – except that we do, eventually, understand that the accused, for all his strange, seemingly unmotivated deceptions, is undoubtedly a decent human being, worthy of our attention, sympathy and respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though formally inventive, Close-Up confirms that its creator is no formalist. The film is driven both by deep, unsentimental compassion and by genuine philosophical curiosity; it explores the fraught relationships between truth and falsehood, film and ‘reality’, intention and action, and acknowledges, from start to finish, the role and responsibility of the director in his engagement with the people in his film. Also admirably typical of Kiarostami’s best work is his admission – indeed, insistence – that the film is incomplete until viewers respond by engaging with its artifice and actively using their imaginations. For Kiarostami, the unshown, the unsaid, the unknown were crucially important; meaning was inextricably linked to mystery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Geoff Andrew</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Had Californian sunlight ever looked as suggestive or sinister before the sharply etched dream world of Meshes of the Afternoon? Certainly, it soon would, in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity (1944) and many later films noirs. That affiliation was first proposed by J. Hoberman in the 1970s. But Meshes has been invoked as seminal by many traditions over eight decades. For years, this 14-minute film was claimed as a founding inspiration of a distinctively American form of highly personal poetic psychodrama, typified by Stan Brakhage, who hailed Deren as “the mother of us all”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deren’s hands-on promotion of her work became a model for the co-operative movement of the 1960s. Rising interest in women’s cinema would later refocus attention on her pioneering role. Today, she is the only woman among seven experimental filmmakers featured on the front page of the New York Filmmakers Co-op website, while the haunting image of her at a window must be one of the most widely reproduced stills from any avant-garde film. And rising interest in women’s film after the 1970s would focus attention on her aesthetic of ‘vertical cinema’, creating an emotional and intellectual density within rather than between images, as Barbara Hammer has described it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Deren and her co-director Alexander Hammid (originally Hackenschmied) were immigrants from Eastern Europe. She came from a Jewish family background in Ukraine, heavily involved in psychiatry, and he from experimental photography and film in Czechoslovakia. Deren would indignantly reject suggestions of influence from two earlier European avant-garde landmarks, Buñuel and Dalí’s Un chien andalou (1928) and Cocteau’s The Blood of a Poet (Le Sang d’un poète, 1930). But for all its cool originality, the eerie game of repeated symbols that its maker-protagonists play out in their West Hollywood home and garden – with a flower, key and knife linking Deren’s divided self and a sinister mirror-faced figure – has undoubtedly extended the legacy of those earlier works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meshes has never reached the top 100 before in the S&amp;S poll (despite some interesting previous backers, such as Derek Jarman in 1992). So this year’s result must reflect some significant shifts in taste – most obviously the recognition of female creativity apparent in the poll leaders, but perhaps also a renewed interest in the phantasmagoric, as explored by Deren’s most consistent fans among contemporary filmmakers, the David Lynch of Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr., and Jordan Peele.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ian Christie</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Cinema’s poet of the Wild West, John Ford already had countless westerns (among over 100 films) under his belt before reteaming with regular star John Wayne for this disturbing story of racism, obsession and revenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intending to kill his kidnapped niece (Natalie Wood) when he finds her, assuming her long since defiled by her Comanche kidnappers, morally complex Ethan Edwards is the role that convinced many that Wayne could truly act. Ford sets the hulking actor against the awe-inspiringly rugged terrain of Arizona’s Monument Valley and, in the iconic final shot, frames him within the doorway of a homestead, standing outside on the cusp of a civilisation where he can never fit in. It is one of the medium’s most unforgettable images of isolation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The iconic image of Ethan Edwards framed in the doorway, the expanse of the West stretching behind him, is as lyrical as it is telling. A relic of the past, he cannot cross over the threshold into the civilised world. He has helped to preserve a world he cannot be a part of any longer. Racist and unyielding, Ethan is not likeable and his redemption seems impossible. But Ford holds audiences in his visual and narrative thrall to the very end so that when the door shuts on Ethan, it's hard not to think about those who get left behind when the world moves on.” <strong>Domino Renee Perez</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Still mesmerising and full of mystery.” <strong>Christian Viviani</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Perhaps the first, and greatest, revisionist western.” <strong>Jon Towlson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I cannot imagine American cinema without John Ford who, among other things, created and defined the western. This is the supreme masterpiece of the genre, forever compelling and moving, superb in every department, including John Wayne’s greatest performance and arguably the most memorable final shot in all of cinema.” <strong>Angie Errigo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In The Searchers, Ford not only achieves the pinnacle of the western – the most influential and exemplary movie genre in history, to which no other director contributed nearly as many canonical texts – but also inscribes within the film an astonishing critique of his own life’s work up until that point. A grand, brutal and fearless work.” <strong>James Schamus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It has me the moment the door opens. Infuriatingly flawed, but beautiful.” <strong>Tom Ryan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The essence of the American Myth in one film.” <strong>Andreas Kilb</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Searchers is a true Fordian tour de force on the ethical and political conceptions and misconceptions of his own films. It is also an anticipatory model of the modern American epic.” <strong>Eduardo Stupía</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“John Ford’s Homeric milestone about the loneliness of men and the inability to settle down.” <strong>Milan Pavlovic</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Its redface casting and other representational archaisms may rankle contemporary sensibilities, but this stirring, stunningly visualised western saga remains a profoundly ambivalent exploration of both the noblest and darkest impulses that lie at the heart of American history and consciousness.” <strong>Martin Rubin</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Sixty years after it was first released, Cléo from 5 to 7 has finally leapt into the top 20: a slow pace for a film so light on its feet. When was this immaculate feature film, Agnès Varda’s essay on time and space, love and death, ever not on our minds?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arriving with the first surge of the French New Wave, Cléo from 5 to 7 crackles with the energy and modernity of that cinephile movement, but it’s ultimately an introspective piece, characterised by the philosophical preoccupations of Varda’s Left Bank peers. Corinne Marchand plays Cléo, a blonde pop singer whose vanity relaxes as her anxieties swell. As the film begins, she visits a tarot reader, hoping for good news about the medical test results she is awaiting – but the cards spell only death, and transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Cléo’s mind is fixed on the future, Varda’s camera captures her in the present tense, killing time in Paris as she ponders her own decay. Echoing Marcel Duchamp’s 1912 painting Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, Varda dissects a trip down the stairs to emphasise the moment as it passes, one we would otherwise have missed. As Cléo, a Parisian Mrs Dalloway, walks the streets of her city, Varda also captures a broader sense of time, an era in history: Paris in the early 1960s, with its crowds, cafés, shops, music, fashion and cinema. The geography is precise: Varda called the film “the portrait of a woman painted on to a documentary about Paris”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film shifts from colour to blackand- white to remind us that this is what cinema does – it transforms life. A film within the film turns the idea into a joke: life makes no sense in monochrome. But Cléo is transformed by the film, by these 90 minutes and the images of herself and her future that confront her everywhere. In real time, Cléo becomes more real, more subject than object, more human, more in tune with the city. She discards her whipped-cream wig and polka dots for a simple black shift. She performs less and feels more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the kind of playfulness that Varda enjoyed so much, we could call this ticking- clock film timeless. From the feminist analysis of a woman’s commodified beauty and a celebrity’s self-regarding narcissism to the vulnerable heroine acting out her messy emotions in public, the spectre of war and the fear of disease darkening a midsummer day, Cléo from 5 to 7 feels pertinent to the modern moment. It always will. Marchand’s Cléo was pinned in a point in time, but the film marches on, playing on a loop in our imaginations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pamela Hutchinson</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Made on the cusp of WWII, Jean Renoir’s satire of the upper-middle classes was banned as demoralising by the French government for two decades after its release. Renoir, a director associated with the left wing Popular Front, turned his gaze away from working people to the haute bourgeoisie. Taking its cue from the classic stage farces of Musset and Beaumarchais, Renoir sets his action during a shooting weekend at a country house. It’s an upstairs-downstairs world where servants and masters become enmeshed in a tangle of desire, a jumble of motivations in which, in the film’s famous phrase, “Everyone has their reasons”. At the film’s centre is the amiable Octave (played by Renoir), whose best intentions lead to tragedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shot in long, controlled takes that stress the depth of vision, Renoir’s depiction of an intransigent society teetering blithely into disaster was derided upon release and only later acclaimed as one of cinema’s most vital films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A lesson in life in every word of dialogue, a piece of cinema in every frame. The joy of seeing a movie was never as great as here.” <strong>João Antunes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A merry-go-round of love and sorrow. A masterful comedy of manners replete with unexpected twists and turns.” <strong>Jan Olsson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A stunning panorama of metropolitan and provincial, aristocrat and peasant, nationalism and cosmopolitanism, and a tale of two marriages that seems to sum up life in Europe just before World War II.” <strong>Carrie Rickey</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In this film we can find everything: the decadence of European culture before the war, the creative freedom of a film director both modern and primitive, the infinite potential of filming in deep-focus and long shots to grab and replicate the complexity, the openness, the elusiveness of reality.” <strong>Roberto Manassero</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Probably the best example of the Renoir style, combining graceful mise en scène, seamless plotting and the peerless command of cinematic technique.” <strong>Charles Ramírez Berg</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No more devastatingly ironic and subtle critique of wealth, power and privilege has ever been made. A great film by a committed activist filmmaker.” <strong>Ian Aitken</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Luminous, masterful filmmaking with a piercing melancholy.” <strong>Anupama Chopra</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Characters and events move between the foreground, middle ground and background through deep focus and long shots. A masterpiece that uses cinema as a playground.” <strong>Raymond Phatanavirangoon</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“To be scathing and humanist and gentle at the same time, and tell your tale effortlessly – that’s Renoir’s genius. One of the world’s great filmmakers, and this is his greatest achievement.” <strong>Eddie Muller</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Deceptively light-handed charm throughout the upstairs, downstairs antics in a country house doesn’t obscure Jean Renoir’s contempt for the underlying darkness and his prescience of what was to imminently befall such people. Still delightful, perfectly on target and still imitated in film and television by people who possibly don’t even know they are doing it.” <strong>Angie Errigo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hands down the greatest film featuring a gorilla suit.” <strong>Michael Atkinson</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>If you want a film that exemplifies and honours the impossible, arbitrary and contradictory history and nature of moviemaking, look no further. Hollywood movies are an artform and a mass entertainment, the product of a singular vision and of a ruthless industry, the work of great directors and the alchemical result of a thousand collaborations, coincidences and backsagainst- the-wall snap decisions. The Godfather is all of the above and more – an unimaginably dark story that begins with the hopeful sentence “I believe in America,” a fat, full saga that, two years after its release, revealed itself to be merely the middle of a fatter, fuller saga, and a work the creation of which has generated its own mythic origin stories, from the director who wouldn’t compromise to the leading man nobody was sure could pull it off. It is enduring and defining art, alchemically transmuted from the pages of an OK bestseller and the imaginations of everyone involved, first among them its great co-writer and director Francis Ford Coppola. As James Caan’s Sonny Corleone says in one of the film’s most enduring scenes, “This is business, and this man is takin’ it very, very personal.” So much of the most brilliant work from Hollywood emerged from the conviction that a movie could be both. Every scene of The Godfather makes the case for that belief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movie exists on countless timelines – it was an early peak for its director, given his big studio shot at the unimaginable age of 32; a mind-blowing return to form for Marlon Brando; a stunning launch for Al Pacino; a benchmark achievement of New Hollywood; and a gauntlet thrown down by its cinematographer Gordon Willis, whose brown-black-and-blacker lighting and compositions changed the look of movies. Its most experienced actor made his debut in the 1930s; its newcomers are still working today. While no movie can be said to gather both the past and the future of filmmaking into itself, The Godfather comes thrillingly close. It’s a crime story, a family story that plunders the word ‘family’ for comedy, emotion and profound horror, an immigrant story and a cautionary tale about the American hunger for power; it contains multitudes. Were the screen suddenly to triple in size, as it does in Abel Gance’s 1927 epic Napoléon (a film Coppola reveres), you sense that a teeming world would reveal itself as always having been there. But the world within Coppola’s frame is big enough; half a century later, we can still walk around in it and discover something new about moviemaking and life with every visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mark Harris</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Associated with 1920s German Expressionism, with its exaggerated sets and lighting techniques, F.W. Murnau brought the style with him to Hollywood for this expensive super-production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simple story of a husband’s betrayal of his wife with a treacherous city girl, the film moves from a fairytale-like depiction of rural life to a dynamic portrait of the bustling modern American city. Explored in elaborate tracking shots by Charles Rocher and Karl Struss’s pioneering camerawork, as when the unnamed Man and Wife first arrive by tram, the city set was one of the most costly yet produced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was a commercial flop, though the achievement did not go unheralded: Sunrise was awarded a special Oscar for unique and artistic production at the first ever Academy Awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Still staggering in the vast sweep of its technical creativity and the delicate honesty of its central two performances. Huge and intimate and lovely.” <strong>Chloe Walker</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Film language reached such exciting heights in the hands of Lang, Murnau and other silent expressionists, it’s almost a shame that sound came along.” <strong>Peter Debruge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The supreme example of what was at risk of being lost when the talkies arrived. Thank God that Murnau slipped this one under the wire.” <strong>James Swanton</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s quite possible that cinema peaked in 1927, and considering the greatness of Sunrise there’s not even any shame in that.” <strong>Eric Hynes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The summit of the then-new artform. Since then, in so many ways, it’s been a downhill road for American filmmaking.” <strong>Joseph McBride</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One of the finest silent films. Stunning cinematography, perfect direction, excellent acting. Still moving today.” <strong>Jean-Marc Leveratto</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How hatred and romance are intertwined, as are beauty and death.” <strong>Charlotte Garson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sunrise is the perfect match between the German way of framing and lighting emotions and a simple, moving, universal love story.” <strong>Carlo Chatrian</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“For the sophistication, the poetry and the tears. The most beautiful film ever, as Truffaut rightly stated.” <strong>Claude Bertemes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Murnau is an absolute genius of images and his first American picture is probably the most beautiful and moving silent film in the world, and the most moving love drama ever made.” <strong>Frédéric Maire</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One of the most beautiful films ever made. Murnau’s mise en scène is brilliant; he truly understood the essence of the cinematographic image.” <strong>Miquel Escudero Diéguez</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Murnau really was able to express everything with the cinematographic means available. He needed no sound and hardly any intertitles, yet his storytelling is crystal clear.” <strong>René Wolf</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As its subtitle says, it’s just “a tale of two humans”, but the whole world of humanity is in this film.” <strong>Peter Hourigan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“For being as sexy, slippery, gorgeous and inventive now as it was then, and for refusing to simplistically take sides between pastoral nostalgia and bewitching novelty.” <strong>Nick Davis</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>The most enduring of the four MGM collaborations between Gene Kelly and his director and co-choreographer Stanley Donen, Singin’ in the Rain rises ten places from 20th in 2012 to land in the top ten again. The film’s ascent almost feels like a given, due to the effervescence that may be its defining characteristic and the scarcity of that quality in our trying times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, typically for anything that seems so effortless, Kelly and Donen’s achievement was in fact the product of an enormous amount of toil and trouble. At the project’s outset, the legendary writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green tried and failed to get out of the gig when MGM musical head Arthur Freed ordered them to build a new movie on top of a batch of tunes by Freed and his partner Nacio Herb Brown that were gathering dust. (Indeed, ‘Singin’ in the Rain’ itself had made its screen debut in The Hollywood Revue of 1929.) Debbie Reynolds’ ordeal filming the ‘Good Morning’ tap-dance number famously left her with bloody feet. As for the title song, six months of rehearsal culminated in Gene Kelly gamely splashing about while running a high fever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of that suffering is discernible on screen, which is one of the many delightful ironies about Hollywood’s most deeply cherished movie about the making of a Hollywood movie. Pulling back the curtain to show yet more dazzling drapery, Comden and Green celebrate an earlier era of Tinseltown chancers and hustlers with a tale of a production caught between the silent and sound eras. Kelly’s plucky hoofer and stuntman-turned-star Don Lockwood leads the charge to retrofit a swashbuckler picture named The Duelling Cavalier to take advantage of the new vogue for sound, with his new sweetie Kathy (Reynolds) being his best means of disguising the squawky voice of his leading lady Lina (a hilarious Jean Hagen).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several movies besides Don’s latest somehow contained within the text of Singin’ in the Rain (including, if we are to believe the deliciously meta billboard in the final shot, Singin’ in the Rain). Cheekily purporting to reveal its own means of production while still delivering one unabashedly theatrical showstopper after another, Kelly and Donen’s masterwork anticipates the brassy postmodernism of Moulin Rouge! (2001). But like such fellow homage-payers as The Artist (2011) and La La Land (2016), Baz Luhrmann’s rendition feels meagre compared to the original and its seemingly inexhaustible bounty of ingenuity, bravado and sheer unabashed joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jason Anderson</strong></p>\r\n",

This could easily be an indulgent mess, but Vertov’s grasp of his medium is so philosophically sure-footed that it’s just as stimulating many decades later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“David Abelevich Kaufman, also known as Dziga Vertov (a Ukrainian phrase roughly meaning ‘spinning top’), was born in 1896 into a Jewish book-dealer’s family in the city of Białystok, then part of the Russian Empire, in modernday Poland. He understood Lenin’s philosophy that film was the most important of all the propaganda forms (especially among a largely illiterate population) and his Anniversary of the Revolution (1918), which may be the first documentary ever made, should be studied in every film school. Though none of us have truly experienced Man with a Movie Camera – which has not been seen in its original form since the 1930s due to it being widely replicated and distributed at an inaccurate speed, significantly changing its rhythm and accents in a way that does not match its original score – I’m still dazzled by its artistry and anticipate the forthcoming restoration.” <strong>Dorota Lech</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“‘Down with bourgeois fairytale plots and scenarios – long live life as it is!’ So said Dziga Vertov, for whom documentary was the only true revolutionary form as it freed film from false scenarios and performing actors. Man with a Movie Camera, about life in a Soviet city from dawn to dusk, was certainly revolutionary in its approach to image creation, which continually undermines and extends itself to dazzling and witty effect. As well as Vertov, the Kino-Eye Council of Three – which attempted to engender a new kind of perception through cinematic montage – comprised Vertov’s editor wife, Elizaveta Svilova, and his camera operator brother, Mikhail Kaufman. All three deserve authorship credit for the film.” <strong>Helen DeWitt</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The defining aspirational work of documentary cinema, this film understands and celebrates the power of cinematic manipulation to uncover profound artistic, emotional and existential truths.” <strong>Alan Mattli</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The dynamism of Vertov’s camerawork and montage reflect the enthusiasm of the era for speed and movement, presuppositions of urban modernity.” <strong>Carlos Alberto Mattos</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This dynamic documentary is much more than a great city symphony. It is an ode to cinema and its infinite possibilities as well as the clearest example of how even the reality that nonfiction films return to us is always constructed, the outcome of manipulation.” <strong>Cristina Formenti</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Defiantly sui generis and unorthodox as he’s always seemed, it may be that David Lynch has by now become a paradigmatic voice of our times. What has long been labelled ‘Lynchian’, instead of merely ruling over our culture’s more delicious margins, might be instead how modern life feels for most of us – a clotted dream of irrational seizures and psychosexual secrets and desires wracked by incomprehensible forces. Certainly, the rise of his crepuscular masterpiece Mulholland Dr. up the new poll’s canonical ladder – 20 rungs, from 28 in 2012 – suggests that we’re coming around to accepting Lynch’s disorienting voice as paradigmatic, even necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having begun as a post-Twin Peaks TV pilot, dumped by ABC and expanded upon into something completely different, Lynch’s film is his gay Anna Karenina (1878), his Hollywood death dive, his final salute to the legacy mysteries of Vertigo (1958) and his deepest dish of metaphysical tragedy. In the deftest of the filmmaker’s gnomic bifurcations, the movie’s flow runs from network-gloss irony, through a tunnel of angst, to a Sapphic wander through Desolation Row, with its two heroines (Naomi Watts and Laura Harring) also doubled up, playing out two contrasting narratives, each potentially and mysteriously the psychic B-side of the other. Identity, in Hollywood, is a quantum reality, a fact that meets Lynch’s lust for instability head on. Perhaps that is the resonating clue as to the film’s ascendant critical regard: its essential, unreasonable slipperiness, its fierce embrace of uncertainty and the indeterminate, speaks more to our fraught present, 21 years later, than it did to its heyday during the pre-9/11 Bush administration. (Not that it wasn’t beloved then, reaping dozens of criticgroup awards and getting Lynch an Oscar nomination for Best Director.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film’s unironic payload of wrenching heartbreak, swimming up from a swampy dream of ironic strangeness, is singular in his oeuvre, as if the vulnerabilities of young women in the twisty roads and dusty hills of the American movie struck him in ways that the dark plight of smalltown Lumberton/ Twin Peaks high-schoolers didn’t quite? Perhaps. But it’s still a maddening, freaky, mysterious thing, seductively interpretable but, ultimately, Lynchianly resistant to final readings. That’s integral to its allure, too. It’s like a hieroglyph you’re always on the verge of translating or a lover’s sphinx-like expression in bed that suggests betrayal, devotion or something in between.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Michael Atkinson</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>The first time I watched Beau travail, on DVD, in my childhood bedroom, in the spring of 2014, I didn’t know how it would end. My face split into a grin of disbelief as the credits rolled and I rewound the final scene. More than 20 years after its initial release, that set piece, soundtracked by Corona’s 90s Eurodance hit ‘The Rhythm of the Night’, with its climactic burst of feeling, is as well-known as the film itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It started as a sort of joke. Claire Denis was commissioned by the TV network Arte to make a film about foreignness and so, wryly, provocatively, she made a movie in which her own people were the foreigners. In Marseille, Sergeant Galoup (Denis Lavant) reflects on his time as ‘a perfect legionnaire’ in Djibouti, East Africa, serving the French Foreign Legion. He and his soldiers, including the undeniably pretty and unusually well-liked Gilles Sentain (Grégoire Colin), perform highly choreographed military drills in the desert heat. Under the blazing sun, resentments simmer. In the evenings, the men dance at a nightclub with the local women, who are beautiful, modern and ambivalent. Djibouti, a former French colony, gained independence in 1977. These soldiers are irrelevant; the colonial project is obsolete. ‘Unfit for life, unfit for civilian life’ is how Galoup describes himself in his diary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But feeling unmoored from one’s purpose – feeling like a foreigner to your own life – is a timeless conundrum, and one that seems to resonate with both film lovers and filmmakers (Barry Jenkins has mentioned its influence on 2016’s Moonlight). It remains Denis’s only true crowd-pleaser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denis’s great gift is her ability to evoke emotion with gesture and juxtaposition. In the Djibouti desert, water shimmers and ripples, naked shoulders perspire and black mosquito nets recall sheer lingerie. In a Claire Denis film, dialogue is sparse, but images are charged with meaning. ‘Making films, for me, is to get rid of explanation,’ she told the Guardian back in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final scene is pure release: a wordless explanation after 90 minutes of tension. Visual references travel through quotations in other works and, in recent times, through the internet. Films are portioned up and divorced from their original contexts, re-appropriated and shared as memes. I wonder if the renewed popularity of Beau travail in this decade’s Greatest Films poll is a result of its increased visibility among a younger generation, many of whom have likely encountered, or at least revisited, its euphoric dancefloor-set conclusion via their computers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Simran Hans</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>A year before the first moon landing, Stanley Kubrick envisioned an outer space where vast spacecraft revolve weightlessly to the strains of Johann Strauss’s Blue Danube waltz. 2001 revolutionised the depiction of the cosmos on film, at the same time – with the HAL-9000 computer that fatally malfunctions during a mission to Jupiter – sounding a warning about unbridled technological advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beginning with primordial apes discovering tools and climaxing with astronaut David Bowman (Keir Dullea) travelling beyond the limits of the known universe, Kubrick’s film was an intellectual (and psychedelic) event in the late 1960s. A ‘match cut’ which quickly replaces a bone thrown upwards by an ape with a similarly shaped spaceship floating through space, thereby compressing millennia of human evolution, is justly celebrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“‘If Kubrick could get rid of the human element, he could make the perfect film,’ joked Malcolm McDowell. But here, he almost does. By acting, arrogantly, as if nobody had ever made a really good science-fiction film before, Kubrick solves all the genre’s problems methodically but also pushes it into epic, mythic, spiritual terrain. It’s stately, bold, astonishingly beautiful. The great rationalist suddenly blasts us off into a psychedelic experience which doesn’t yield fully to reason. It’s not even certain if the film is optimistic or despairing (yet colourful).” <strong>David Cairns</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Kubrick’s epic contemplation on the nature and origins of humanity remains one of cinema’s greatest technical feats, and one of its most poetic and awe-inspiring.” <strong>Stuart Brown</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Human evolution, both physical and spiritual, translated into confoundingly hypnotic imagery.” <strong>Alan Mattli</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“2001: A Space Odyssey created a vocabulary from a vacuum; there was nothing like it before or after. It does that with so much majesty, so much intrigue, yet it manages to go into a very deep philosophical, even spiritual, personal space.” <strong>Bedatri Choudhury</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It took the art of film somewhere it had never been before, and nothing has gone anywhere near it since.” <strong>Eric Hynes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A space opera of the most ambitious kind. Kubrick&nbsp;weds his stunning imagery to a beautiful soundtrack and creates something that can only be cinema.” <strong>John Bleasdale</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A bold and confident work that makes no apologies for its bombast, and nor should it: this is cinema at its operatic peak.” <strong>David Heslin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“At the same time a science-fiction spectacle, an anthropological speculation and a philosophical meditation, Kubrick’s film created an unavoidable monolith in its genre.” <strong>Carlos Alberto De Mattos</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“2001 is far beyond a technical achievement – it is a gateway to a vast universe where mankind is infinitesimal.” <strong>Naman Ramachandran</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Almost incomprehensibly massive, not just in its scope and scale but in its ideas and philosophies. It’s a genre movie asking the biggest of questions and it has a scary computer to boot.” <strong>Rosie Fletcher</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Retains its power to fill the mind with mystery and wonder, your head forever tilted skywards.” <strong>Peter Howell</strong></p>\r\n",

With a fresh generation of critics chiming in – one that cinematically came of age when Wong’s film had already attained modern-classic status – it was sure to rise up the ranks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Mood for Love’s spectacular top five placement, however, demonstrates the broadly seductive allure of a mid-century Hong Kong period piece that looks both forward and back, wallowing in nostalgia for a purer, lusher form of cinematic romanticism while carving out more modern, even avant-garde forms of sensual and psychological expression from its saturated style. It’s a film that invites you to think, “They don’t make them like they used to” – even though you know they never quite made them quite like this. The film’s essential romantic narrative of forbidden yearnings and missed connections may be the stuff of vintage melodrama, but less familiar is the way Wong expands the simple anatomy of a thwarted love affair into an elastic meditation on personal unrest, political statelessness and the violence of time’s unrelenting passage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film never tells you it’s about any of that, of course. Wong’s porous, often headily non-verbal filmmaking trusts us to feel the lovers’ ennui and melancholy – and further, to identify it within ourselves – via its sheer accumulation of sounds, images and sense memories: be it the damp wraiths of steam swirling from an opened noodle container, the warm, vinyl-roughened croon of Nat King Cole on the soundtrack or the impossible lobby-card beauty of Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, both preserved here in their ravishing prime, and somehow convincing as ordinary mortals made movie-star beautiful by love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re living through a fairly stifled age of visual storytelling, as the televisual pull of streaming culture encourages filmmakers to think smaller and more literal. As moving as its relationship study is, anybody who thinks of In the Mood for Love, however, thinks first of those sensory flourishes and grace notes – it’s a film that even, somehow, has a signature scent. Its visual and sonic fragments cumulatively evoke not just a firmly past time and place but a mood, a feeling, a sorrow that drifts from the film’s world to ours. That must account for its enduring, even increasing, popularity: it lingers like an unrequited crush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>The later films of Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu are marked by a striking uniformity of theme and form. These are stories of family life involving inevitable rupture, as things change, daughters marry, widowers grow old. Ozu films this bittersweet natural progression in his unmistakably controlled, minimal style, typified by head-on shots with the camera at the height of a seated observer. Tokyo Story is the best known (in the West) of this extraordinary cycle, a quietly tragic tale of an ageing couple coming to the painful realisation that their family no longer needs them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luminous Ozu regular Setsuko Hara plays daughter-in-law Noriko. Alhough not the same character as the Norikos she plays in Late Spring (1949) and Early Summer (1951), the films are considered a loose trilogy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A brilliant film on generational change, a society in transition and what it means to feel you are no longer needed. Ozu is always the filmmaker to turn to if you want to see how to do more with less – the filmmaker of the quotidian, melding economy and intensity to extraordinary effect.” <strong>Maria Delgado</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The evocative power of this film remains intact. The soft melancholy, the passage of time, the understanding of life as a spiritual adventure. All from the adventures and misadventures of a family. So simple, so complex.” <strong>Pedro Adrián Zuluaga</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A profound film. Ozu’s Zen style at its simplest and most sublime.” <strong>Patrick McGilligan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A film full of wisdom, understanding and acceptance of life that never ceases to move and amaze. A beautiful heartbreak of a movie.” <strong>José Arroyo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A psychologically healing film, a magically calming one.” <strong>Saleem Albeik</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This extraordinary study of ageing, mortality and family life (among other things) has that unforgettable moment: ‘Isn’t life disappointing?’ – ‘Yes’ (with a smile).” <strong>Geoff Andrew</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Its reputation for greatness is beyond deserved but canonisation also risks smothering its still live charge, pinning behind glass a work of art that still has the power to astonish, disrupt and shatter. Few works have ever been as capable of expressing the exquisite beauty and prevailing intolerability of living.” <strong>Eric Hynes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Poignancy, regret and sadness come through all the keener by virtue of the restraint of performance, composition and editing.” <strong>Richard Dyer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A film brimming with restrained emotion, which is unleashed through a level of unparalleled film craftsmanship. The model on which many of the world’s greatest films are based.” <strong>Akira Mizuta Lippit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ozu’s films always feel deceptively simple, despite their unusual framing and editing structures. It’s not just his mastery of cinema as a form that’s so impressive but the sheer humanity and compassion with which he manages to fill his films.” <strong>David Morrison</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A gently tragic film about the wheel turning.” <strong>Tom Ryan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As you watch, it seems nothing is happening. When it’s over you realise you’ve just seen an encyclopedia of the human condition.” <strong>Charles Ramírez Berg</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>The 26-year-old Orson Welles, already renowned for his work in radio and theatre, used the unprecedented artistic license offered to him by RKO to create a fictionalised portrait of one of America’s most powerful men – press baron William Randolph Hearst. Charting the rise of Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles himself) – who decides to start a newspaper with his inherited fortune – Welles’ film is a classic story of the corrupting effects of power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of deep-focus photography (keeping both foreground and background in focus) and abstracted camera angles, the non-chronological narrative structure and overlapping dialogue, were just some of the myriad formal innovations that Welles brought together for his groundbreaking debut. Such novelty and controversy proved a curse for Welles, whose career never enjoyed such indulgence again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Citizen Kane remains the ultimate commentary on American culture since the early 20th century. It conveys America’s inherent polarities (individualism vs collective impulses; libertarianism vs puritanism; innocence vs corruption; the underdog mentality to rebel against oppression vs the impulse to rule over the masses through duping strategies) via a deft synergy of form and content. It has never been more rewarding to screen and talk about this film than in our current political moment.” <strong>Roy Grundmann</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The former champion still feels like a grand summation of film’s early development as an artform and a glimpse of the future, too. At the same time, it’s a hugely entertaining portrait of the media narcissism and demagoguery that underscore American politics.” <strong>Scott Tobias</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It still amazes for its formal bravado, a barrage of cinematographic strategies which retain their innovative resonances. The film’s reputation as representing the apogee of an ossified ‘canon’ of outstanding films should not minimise its qualities – it deserves to be so recognised. It combines the restless energy of its subject with formal experimentation which demonstrates the artistry of filmmaking as a collaborative enterprise when new technical approaches were being explored.” <strong>Sarah Street</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sadly, it’s fashionable now to chip away at its greatness. This temptation should be resisted. The audacious American masterpiece of the 20th century, not only for its cinematic innovations and storytelling vigour, but for how accurately it dissects the ‘American character’.” <strong>Eddie Muller</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What else is there to say about Kane? It will always be remembered for novelty, for vision, for the sheer audacity of its existence.” <strong>Oris Aigbokhaevbolo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The ultimate in movie baroque. Welles’s film is a twisted pearl – glorious, florid, overweening – about crazed ambition and the virtues and innocences it crushes in its wake.” <strong>Nigel Andrews</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A film that amply rewards repeated viewings, revealing new depths, new nuanced details, new mysteries. There is no greatest film, but if there were, for me this would surely be the strongest contender.” <strong>Geoff Andrew</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What, I’m going to leave this off, so I can look more like a wild individualist? A brilliant cinematic mind jumps into the medium, determined to see what he can make it do. It may not invent anything but it packs in a ton of radical creativity and unconventionality.” <strong>David Cairns</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>So, wobbles at the top. Of all the films that could surmount this poll (there have now been four, across eight decades), it seems apt that Alfred Hitchcock’s woozy psychoromance should lose its grip as soon as it reached the summit – that this delirious maunder with James Stewart’s acrophobic, impressionable detective through an absurd murder-seduction intrigue in a winding San Francisco wonderland should place less steadily than the obdurate Citizen Kane (1941), previously enshrined on high for 40 years. Still, its fall has been less steep than that of Bicycle Thieves (1948), which sank from first to seventh between 1952 and 1962, or this year’s plunge of Jean Renoir’s La Règle du jeu (1939), previously a top-ten perennial, from fourth to 13th. Vertigo came just seven votes short of the top spot – proportionally closer than in 2002, when it missed deposing Orson Welles’s reigning champ by only four votes – while the distance between it and Kane (now third) has grown since 2012, from 34 votes to 45. This is not a film in rapid descent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of last year, Vertigo’s 1958 release date puts it in the first half of cinema’s history. As that history extends, and this poll grows, so the greater diversity of latter-day filmmaking stretches the voting. In 2012 the film led with 191 votes – meaning it was included in almost a quarter of the entries; this year its 208 votes amounted to half that proportion, 12 per cent. Lifting the lid of the poll, though, shows a more fluid story than just new voters moving on from the old. Vertigo lost nearly three-quarters (139) of its 2012 electors: three-fifths of them to voter attrition (those voters who for whatever reason didn’t show up in 2022), but more turned away from Vertigo (57) than stuck with it (54). Sixteen swung behind it this year after choosing otherwise in 2012. Meanwhile 140 of its 208 votes came from new – and presumably younger – recruits to the electorate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a decade of debate about the justices of cinematic representation, I’d wondered how Hitchcock’s frayed, pessimistic thriller of estrangement would now strike people. Filtering Pygmalion myths of idealisation and exploitation through Proustian memory games – with Bernard Herrmann’s score adding top notes of Wagnerian tragedy – it’s hardly a film that promises hope or amelioration, more a darkly, bottomlessly reflexive portrait of private vices and compulsions; a vortex of perspective-stretching, misdirection and disorientation; a whirlpool of obscure, consuming desire. It seems many of us are still plunging in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nick Bradshaw</strong></p>\r\n",

      "fullDescription": "<p>Such a sudden shake-up at the top of Sight and Sound’s ten-yearly poll! Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) heads the 2022 list. No other film made by a woman has ever even reached the top ten. In the first instance, this is unsurprising: women film directors have always, obviously, been few and far between; equally obviously, the contributing critics have been predominantly male. It was when Sight and Sound expanded the critics’ pool in 2012 that Jeanne Dielman first entered the list, at number 35; its rise to the top now is a triumph for women’s cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But perhaps the ultimate surprise goes even further: the film that collected the most votes in 2022 is made with a cinematic style and strategy closer to avantgarde than mainstream traditions and, furthermore, at just under three and a half hours, demands dedicated viewing. Although confrontational, idiosyncratic and extraordinary films have consistently appeared lower in the lists, the experimental tradition, to which Jeanne Dielman belongs, is – apart perhaps from the recent appearance of Dziga Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera (1929) – absent. While it has brought this tradition to the top of the list, Jeanne Dielman is inescapably a woman’s film, consciously feminist in its turn to the avant garde. On the side of content, the film charts the breakdown of a bourgeois Belgian housewife, mother and part-time prostitute over the course of three days; on the side of form, it rigorously records her domestic routine in extended time and from a fixed camera position.
